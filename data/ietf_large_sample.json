    "body": "As to the TELNET and FTP to historic discussion, may I add, for your \r\nconsideration:\r\n\r\nTELNET and FTP are not the most suitable protocols anymore for today's \r\nhostile environment that is the Internet.\r\n\r\nEasy to use on a windows machine, a penguin box or a Mac.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, there are plenty of cases where \"just use SSH\" does not work:\r\n\r\n  * Think embedded controllers with limited resources, like small\r\n    micro-controllers. \"But you should just use a bigger controller, it\r\n    is not 1980 anymore\" - some controllers live in an environment that\r\n    needs to be kept on-temperature with an accuracy of one thousandth\r\n    of a degree and there, self-heating micro-controllers is something\r\n    you really do *not* want. Other electronics works in a vacuum\r\n    environment and suddenly, cooling of self-heating electronics is\r\n    more involved.\r\n  * Other controllers have strict real-time response requirements, for\r\n    instance because control movements of very heavy objects with an\r\n    acceleration of many G's. On those, a debug facility using telnet\r\n    can be added w/o too much issue, however just think the processing\r\n    power required to do knapsack re-keying to do a \"SSH session\r\n    re-key\": if a board is doing real-time stuff then you do NOT want\r\n    something compute-intensive competing with the controller job.\r\n  * And in some cases, SSH doesn't bring anything. Encryption only makes\r\n    sense if the integrity of the resulting connection can be verified,\r\n    which means a way to check, upfront, if the host key of the\r\n    connection is valid. Now, assume that an embedded controller needs\r\n    to be replaced. That leaves several scenarios: One scenario is that\r\n    the SSH host key is pinned and the same on all controllers of the\r\n    same type (and hence predictable, and hence SSH pointless).\r\n    Another scenario is that the SSH key is board specific and hence,\r\n    changes when the board is replaced, but then how does one verify the\r\n    new host key of the replacement board? If there is no way to verify\r\n    the host key, then integrity cannot be checked and hence again SSH\r\n    is pointless.\r\n    Keep in mind that these environments do NOT have DNS, and perhaps\r\n    you don't want dependency on services like DNS if one second of\r\n    machine downtime costs as much as USD 50 per second. I am not\r\n    kidding, and my number is conservative.\r\n\r\nThe above is the complex-machine, industrial world I live in. And for \r\nthose who think this is academic, the machines I talk about are used to \r\ncreate the processors, memory and the other semiconductors of the \r\ncomputer you use to read this email (among others).\r\n\r\nMay I ask that if we do \"move to historic\" action, we qualify this to \r\nthe public internet only and explicitly put up a disclaimer that for \r\nembedded environments, requirements may be different and TELNET and FTP \r\nmay be appropriate, perhaps more appropriate than \"just use SSH\" and \r\nhence TELNET/FTP clients and servers have a use in these environments?\r\n\r\nFor your consideration,\r\n\r\nGeert Jan\r\n(explicitly speaking my own opinion here, hence not mentioning machine \r\nnames)\r\n\r\n",

The best way for us to ensure this, is to only issue letters to people who have paid for their registration, but in order to bring this forward we have had to put significant work into the meeting registration system to allow us to have registration open for two meeting at once.

Writing with my hat as\r\neditor of RFC 5321 and draft-ietf-emailcore-rfc5321bis (the latter\r\nshould be in IETF LC soon) on but without necessarily speaking for\r\nanyone else...\r\n\r\nAs far as the broader Internet community is concerned, the main\r\noutput of the IETF is standards track documents that are supposed to\r\nbe produced to make the Internet work better.  As part of that\r\nprocess, we often spend considerable energy discussing requirements,\r\nincluding, in BCP14, the differences between MUST, SHOULD, MAY, etc.\r\nIndependent of what providers the LLC selects to process out mail, if\r\nmessages are sent out with ietf.org sender addresses that violate\r\nMUST-level provisions of RFCs 5321 or 5322 or other email specs, the\r\nclear signal to anyone who notices is that, regardless of what BCP 14\r\nsays, the definition of \"MUST\" and \"MUST NOT\" includes \"unless we\r\nfind it operationally or commercially inconvenient.   \r\n\r\nThe IETF is in an almost unique position in that regard.  If some\r\nordinary enterprise (or even Amazon or Google) decides to ignore\r\nrequirements in our standards, those standards are voluntary and that\r\nreally is a commercial decision regardless of what Rich or others\r\nmight think of it.  But if we do so in obvious ways --in this case,\r\nin email we are sending out-- that calls the credibility and\r\nintegrity of our standards into question.\r\n\r\nNow, I have not done enough analysis to know whether the bad behavior\r\nRich describes extends to things that are required by email\r\nstandards.  Lack of response to 2142 service addresses probably does\r\nnot count because the spec uses words like \"encourage\" and because it\r\nimposes no requirements if the organization does not implement the\r\nassociated service although it would be in better taste to reject\r\nmessages for unsupported addresses rather than accepting and then\r\nignoring them.  In any event, if a message is sent out by\r\nSomeUser@ietf.org, my reading of RFC 2142 is that the obligation to\r\nmaintain those addresses belongs to the IETF, not Amazon SES.  On the\r\nother hand, were Amazon SES to ignore the RFC 5321 requirement about\r\nthe insertion of \"Received:\" headers containing FROM clauses as one\r\nof their competitors does, that would, IMO, be a serious problem if\r\nthe IETF were using them to send out messages from IETF addresses and\r\ndomains.\r\n\r\n    john'\r\n\r\n--On Thursday, July 25, 2024 09:27 -0400 Rich Kulawiec <rsk@gsp.org>\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n> On Tue, Jul 02, 2024 at 12:24:51PM +0100, Jay Daley wrote:\r\n>> For now at least then, we are going to continue with the plan to\r\n>> move to Amazon SES for mail sending.\r\n> \r\n> I commented on this off-list, but on reflection, decided to send\r\n> something on-list as well.\r\n> \r\n> This is a terrible idea.

    "body": "Hi Toerless\r\n\r\nThanks for your note.  As this is primarily an LLC issue, I will pick it up.\r\n\r\nThroughout the run up to this meeting (and all meetings) we have been in contact with multiple people who have visa issues and we use whatever levers we have with the government of the host country to support those visa applications. The issue we have seen this time around is primarily people not having their visa application be completed in time, despite them applying far in advance of the recommended timing.  We have been putting significant effort into this with direct communication with the Canadian government, but by necessity that is all behind the scenes.\r\n\r\nWe normally know the full numbers of people who were unable to get visas as we refund the difference between their onsite registration and the remote fee, but for this meeting we have the added complication of multiple people who were unable to get here due to travel difficulties associated with the Crowdstrike outage.  As a result, we have reached out directly to a number of organisations to get numbers for those affected and we will follow up on that in the post-meeting survey.\r\n\r\nAlso, after this meeting, we will continue to engage with the Canadian government to try to prevent this happening for future meetings.  However, and this is a big however, government 'policies' can change very quickly and we have very limited influence over that.  Things could be entirely different for our next meeting here, despite any effort we put into it, for reasons entirely outside of our control.  Ultimately, both the US and Canada have demonstrated significant problems for us around visas, though different problems, and so long as we are required to meeting in North America, the best we can do is rotate between those two.\r\n\r\nFor us to issue letters of invitation we need to ensure that we only do so for people who genuinely need them for an IETF meeting.  If we don’t and we allow our letters of invitation to be misused, then they will simply be disregarded and we may put ourselves at legal risk.  The best way for us to ensure this, is to only issue letters to people who have paid for their registration, but in order to bring this forward we have had to put significant work into the meeting registration system to allow us to have registration open for two meeting at once.  This is now complete and we should be switching that on later this year.  Of course, that also means that we need to bring forward our work to identify a local host who can provide the letter of invitation in those countries that require a local signatory.\r\n\r\nWe are also examining if we can offer letters of invitation to people who have a good track record of onsite participation even before registration opens for a meeting.  So far, we have worked with some larger organisations that send multiple participants to test this, with a view to automating that somehow.\r\n\r\nI think that covers everything, but please let me know if you have any further questions.\r\n\r\nJay\r\n\r\n> On 24 Jul 2024, at 09:31, Toerless Eckert <tte@cs.fau.de> wrote:\r\n> \r\n> Dear LLC/IESG:\r\n> \r\n> Given how i may unfortunately not be able to raise the questions tonight at the plenary, i wanted\r\n> to ask them here to the IESG/LLC and Cc the relevant lists:\r\n> \r\n> 1.

    "body": "As you should be aware, the Ombudsteam investigates complaints of \r\nharassment, as RFC 7776 describes:\r\n\r\n    ...problematic behavior that may be more\r\n    personal and that can occur in the context of IETF activities\r\n    (meetings, mailing list discussions, or social events) that does not\r\n    directly disrupt working group progress but nonetheless is\r\n    unacceptable behavior between IETF Participants. [Sec. 1]\r\n\r\nand does so \"when other IETF policies and procedures do not apply or \r\nhave been ineffective.\" [Sec. 1]\r\n\r\nIf the Ombudsteam finds that harassment has occurred, it can impose a \r\nremedy. Such remedies can be up to and including \"that the Respondent is \r\nno longer permitted to participate in a particular IETF activity, for \r\nexample, ejecting them from a meeting.\" [Sec. 5.1] One other such remedy \r\nmight also include revoking posting rights to IETF mailing lists or \r\nrestricting posting to only specific addresses. This is independent of \r\nthe BCP 83 PR-Action, and importantly because of the confidentiality \r\nrequirement of RFC 7776 does not involve a community Last Call:\r\n\r\n    o  In all cases, the Ombudsteam will strive to maintain\r\n       confidentiality for all parties, including the very fact of\r\n       contact with the Ombudsteam. [Sec. 5]\r\n\r\nThe Ombudsteam takes the imposition of any remedy extremely seriously \r\nand always tries limits its actions to only the minimum remedy that will \r\n\"make sure that the incident does not escalate and to ensure that a \r\nsimilar situation is unlikely to occur with the same Respondent in the \r\nfuture.\" [Sec 5.2] There is an appeals mechanism in RFC 7776, but the \r\nrequirements laid out in RFC 7776 mean that such remedies could be \r\nimposed without notifying the community. We wanted to make sure that the \r\ncommunity is aware of this.\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Dear colleagues,\r\n\r\nI work for the Internet Society though this is not an Internet Society opinion.  I will note, however, that the views I outline here are ones I've held for a while and ones that certainly affected my thinking when appointing a Nomcom Chair.\r\n\r\nOn Sun, Jul 21, 2024 at 03:41:23PM -0400, Keith Moore wrote:\r\n\r\n>Except that the whole nomcom selection process is designed to be \r\n>transparent and resistant to rigging, so having a private discussion \r\n>seems iffy for that reason.\r\n\r\nI could not disagree more with that conclusion.  While much of the selection process is intended to be transparent, the discretion of the Chair is pretty broad in practically everything touching on the entire Nomcom process.  We depend on the Chair to exercise diligence, discretion, openness, and (perhaps above all) devotion to the IETF in operating the Nomcom each year, and it seems to me that this is a case where we have to permit those virtues to function.  I think it would be a terrible mistake to try to engineer rules for when-is-someone-independent when the Chair's virtues are almost certainly likely to be a better guide than some kind of algorithm.  This is _especially_ true because, of course, independent contractors may well have clients (or even one very large client) that could also bring influence to bear, and yet we do not require disclosure of client lists and so on.  Indeed, for a corporation's employees, one very large customer could in theory bring a lot of pressure to bear about preferred outcomes, yet we do not require every employee of any corporation to produce comprehensive customer lists (and I hope even suggesting that would be met with the derision I think it deserves).\r\n\r\nFinally, suppose that some Nomcom member were nefariously hiding their True Motivations behind putative independent status, and said member was actually nursing a private agenda.  Well, that's what the other Nomcom members are for.  None of the Nomcom members needs to be perfectly unbiased because, we hope, the composition of the Nomcom has whittled away the advantage that this or that bias might have.  Far better to put the kind of energy that would be needed to make a rule about \"independent enough\" into problems like how to face down systemic irrelevant biases that are likely to creep into Nomcom deliberations just because of the composition of the community in the first place, without yet diluting the bias towards IETF competence the Nomcom is likely to have because of the eligibility criteria.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nA\r\n\r\n-- \r\nAndrew Sullivan\r\najs@crankycanuck.ca\r\n\r\n",

Just because someone\r\nworked for Acme Anvil until a few days before the NomCom was seated doesn't\r\nmean that they would automatically want to support an Acme employee — they\r\n*might* have just quit because their massive pile of stock options vested,\r\nbut they might equally have been laid off[0][1].\r\n\r\nMuch of the strength of the IETF process is that we try and do the right\r\nthing over blind adherence to policy — we have a random selection of the\r\ncommunity (instead of an algorithm) running the NomCom process, let's give\r\nthem the flexibility to \"Do The Right Thing\" instead of over-processing\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nW\r\n\r\n[0]: Or fired for pushing an update file full of null-bytes (....too soon?\r\n:-))\r\n[1]: I suspect that it's actually more likely that someone would support a\r\ncandidate because they are good friends with them (or reject them because\r\nthey make a snarky comment during last call on a draft, or because they\r\nspilt coffee on their laptop at IETF63 in Paris in 2005, or… ) than because\r\nthey happen to work for the same company…\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> -- Christian Huitema\r\n>\r\n",

As a former experimental physicist, I am probably\r\nbetter informed on the prospects than most in the cryptography community.\r\n\r\nAt this point, we still don't really know what superconductivity is and\r\nwhether it is actually a quantum effect we are seeing in these super cold\r\nqbits or a macro effect mimicking a quantum effect. Nor do we know whether\r\nquantum states can stack to infinite degree. All these things are worth\r\ninvestigating.\r\n\r\nSuperconducting quantum machines are clearly a dead end, the approach does\r\nnot scale, while you can pile up the qbits, the number of quantum\r\noperations you can perform is still horribly limited. And doubling the\r\ncomputation capability is tending to double the cost. Trapped ion machines\r\nare scalable in theory but unbuilt in practice. The problem being that\r\nregardless of how slow progress is, from this point on we always have to\r\naccept the possibility technology advances to the point where building one\r\nis practical within a decade. And since that is an Eschaton level threat,\r\nwe have to take it seriously.\r\n\r\nWhen this happens, a lot of standards rely on RSA and they will need to\r\n> update.\r\n>\r\n> I'm currently looking at DKIM (for email; RFC 6376).\r\n> DKIM uses RSA for signing emails.\r\n> DKIM uses DNS to host the public keys.\r\n>\r\n\r\nDKIM is an authentication technology so we don't actually need to be\r\nconcerned with pre-planning as we do with stored data. It is also an\r\nanti-abuse scheme. Even if someone does build a quantum computer, the\r\nchance that it will be cheap enough to run to bypass anti-spam technology\r\nis vanishingly small. Malicious actors equipped with quantum computers will\r\nhave much more profitable targets. The EMV card payment systems for example.\r\n\r\nIt is also a pretty simple fix, instead of putting the public key in the\r\nDNS, you put the SHA-2/3-512 hash of the key in the DNS and put the public\r\nkey in the signature block.\r\n\r\nIf I was going to be concerned about quantum proofing an IETF\r\nauthentication protocol, DNSSEC would be a much bigger priority for me.\r\n\r\n\r\nGiven how far the telephone system has fallen in the past few years with\r\nVOIP based robocalling abuse, I will be very surprised if we are using the\r\nlegacy phone system in ten years time. Any replacement will have to have\r\naccess control built into the infrastructure. And if we have that for voice\r\nand video, we will use it for messaging, mail and large file transfer as\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nI can't be the only person who has designed such a protocol, surely. All we\r\nneed to do is connect up the Mesh contact book and presence system to MOQ\r\nand we have an open service voice/video system capable of replacing the\r\ntelephone system. The only reason the telephone system is still standing is\r\nthat all the WebRTC based alternatives are proprietary walled gardens which\r\ndon't offer the equivalent of telephone number portability.\r\n\r\nJust finished the GUI client for the Mesh phase 1 functionality and\r\npresented it at HOPE 2024.\r\n",

    "body": "Hi folks,\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Is anyone working on the \"RSA will be deprecated, making DKIM and other protocols broken\" issue?\r\n\r\nLonger decription of the problem:\r\n\r\nThe talk in the crypto community is that RSA will become deprecated when quantum crypto becomes accepted as a standard.\r\nThis could be in a year or a decade, but it's coming.  (Not \"if\", only \"when\".)\r\n\r\nWhen this happens, a lot of standards rely on RSA and they will need to update.\r\n\r\nI'm currently looking at DKIM (for email; RFC 6376).\r\nDKIM uses RSA for signing emails.\r\nDKIM uses DNS to host the public keys.\r\n\r\nThe problems:\r\n\r\n  - Quantum keys are expected to be much larger than RSA keys.\r\n\r\n  - DNS TXT values are limited to 255 characters.\r\n    RSA-1024 encoded as base64 = 172 bytes. That fits, but RSA-1024 is \"weak\" even by today's standards.\r\n    RSA-2048 does not fit in the 255 character limit and needs to be separated into multiple TXT values.\r\n    Quantum keys are expected to be much larger.\r\n\r\n  - Most DNS requests still use UDP.\r\n    That typically limits the minimum unfragmented payload to 512 or 576 bytes (to be safe).\r\n    The unsafe size (including fragmentation) can be 65507 bytes (over IPv4) and a little smaller over IPv6.\r\n    But the second we talk about UDP fragmentation, we hit delivery nightmares that won't be ideal for DNS-based authentication.\r\n    (I think I have the numbers right, but I didn't double-check so feel free to correct me.)\r\n\r\nPossible solutions?\r\n\r\n  - Hope that DNS-over-TCP or DNS-over-QUIC (or anything else \"not UDP\") catches on before quantum becomes a standard.\r\n\r\n  - Increase the minimum UDP size and hope it is big enough to hold a quantum key without fragmentation.\r\n    This goes along with increasing the \"default\" ethernet MTU to something larger than 1500.\r\n\r\n  - Rely on some other distributed system for hosting DKIM keys. (Does any other global distributed system exist besides DNS? Don't say \"blockchain\".)\r\n\r\nI guess my main question is:\r\nIs anyone working on this problem?\r\nEither for DKIM or for protocols in general?\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t-Neal\r\n-- \r\nNeal Krawetz, Ph.D.\r\nHacker Factor Solutions\r\nhttps://hackerfactor.com/\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Call for participation: Bad Attitude Pecha Kucha @ IETF 120\r\nTime: Wednesday, July 24 at 10 pm Vancouver time\r\nLocation: Georgia B\r\n\r\nCome share your favorite stories, rants, or calls to action with your\r\nIETF colleagues. If you have a topic about which you are passionate,\r\nyou can give a Pecha Kucha.\r\n\r\nBy now, most of you probably know this, but for those new to the\r\nevent: a Pecha Kucha is a lightning-talk presentation format,\r\noriginating in Japan, where a speaker presents 20 image-only slides\r\nthat are each on the screen for 20 seconds and advance automatically.\r\nWith each talk lasting for 6:40, it has the feature of forcing\r\npresentations, good or bad, to be focused and brief.\r\n\r\nThis is an unofficial event. Topics are encouraged to be IETF-related\r\nand satirical or controversial in some way, although not\r\nmean-spirited. Anyone can participate in this social event.\r\n\r\nFormat Details:\r\n\r\n* Kyle Rose and Jen Linkova will co-host the event in Vancouver.\r\n\r\n* Presentation slots are open to all interested presenters. Slots are\r\nassigned first-come, first-served.\r\n\r\n* To reserve a presentation slot, send a name and title to Kyle at\r\nkrose@krose.org AND to Jen at furry13@gmail.com and receive\r\nconfirmation.\r\n\r\n* While this recurring event originally hosted exclusively PK-format\r\ntalks, presenters now have two choices for talk format:\r\n\r\n    - You may adhere to the traditional Pecha Kucha format (20 slides,\r\nprimarily image-only, automatically advancing every 20 seconds). We\r\nneed 20 static slides as a PDF. Animations are NOT supported since we\r\nwill be presenting from our own laptops and we only support vanilla\r\nPDF.\r\n\r\n    - You may alternatively use your 6m 40s slot to give a\r\npresentation in some other format, but you will be strictly limited to\r\n400 seconds, after which the Lars Eggert rule¹ will be triggered. We\r\nshould be able to provide you with direct control over slide\r\nadvancement via wireless remote. Animations are still NOT supported\r\nwhen we are presenting from our own laptops. You MAY alternatively use\r\nyour own hardware to present, but you MUST show up at least 15 minutes\r\nbefore the event begins to test that it works and is ready to go with\r\njust an HDMI cable swap.\r\n\r\n* We MUST receive your final slide deck no later than the start of the\r\nPlenary on Wednesday (i.e., by 5:30 pm local time). Earlier is better.\r\nYou REALLY OUGHT TO get them to us at least a day in advance. Decks\r\nreceived after the plenary starts are processed on a best-effort basis\r\nand we MAY replace them with random images of kittens, puppies, and\r\nhummingbirds.\r\n\r\n* There are lots of online tutorials and suggestions for how to make a\r\ngood Pecha Kucha. Here are some links:\r\n\r\n    https://www.pechakucha.com/\r\n    https://blog.indezine.com/2012/05/10-tips-to-create-and-present-pecha.html\r\n    https://catherinecronin.wordpress.com/2012/06/13/pecha-kucha/\r\n\r\n* This is an in-person event only: while talks will be recorded\r\n(thanks to the fine efforts of our own Tero Kivinen), they will not be\r\nlive-streamed and there will be no remote participation.\r\n\r\nWe hope to see you there!\r\n\r\nKyle and Jen\r\n\r\n¹The Lars Eggert rule mandates that when time runs out, the audience\r\nimmediately starts clapping and continues clapping until the speaker\r\ndesists and vacates the podium.\r\n\r\n",

Ten billion secure elements are produced every\r\nyear, including six billion Javacards, which execute applications written\r\nin the Javacard language. The physical size of an SE chip is about 5x5mm².\r\nTLS-SE can be implemented in Javacard, identified by a TLS server name\r\n(SEN, Secure Element Name) included in the historical bytes (up to 15\r\nbytes) of the Answer To Reset (ATR).\r\nSecured resources (SE security level is about EAL6+ according to Common\r\nCriteria standards) are available thanks to Uniform Resource Identifiers\r\n(URI) such as:\r\nshells://sen@server.com/?query, in which the query syntax is an open topic.\r\nA Secure Element server may use a single SE (nano server, [1]) with an\r\nISO7816 physical interface, or a grid of SEs (personal server, [3]), for\r\nexample connected via an I2C bus.\r\nNano servers [1][2] can be designed with a system on chip (SoC) using open\r\nIDEs such as Arduino. With a Wi-Fi interface, the observed power\r\nconsumption is about 0,2 W (5 W/day), so a small solar panel can be used\r\nfor power supply.\r\nPersonal servers [3] use Secure Element Processors (SEP) implementing an\r\nI2C bridge with an ISO7816 interface. They are connected to the internet\r\nvia a TCP/IP host such as Raspberry Pi. They also support the RACS [4]\r\nprotocol for on-demand services. The observed power consumption is about\r\n1,6 W + NSE * 0,15 W.\r\nThe TLS-SE ecosystem [5][6] is based on open hardware and software\r\ntechnologies (Arduino IDE, C/C++ GCC, Javacard Oracle JDK). We are looking\r\nfor partners to develop an application framework realizing open trusted\r\nservices for internet users.\r\n[1] https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-urien-tls-se/\r\n[2] https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-urien-core-tls-se-io/\r\n[3] https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-urien-coinrg-iose/\r\n[4] https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-urien-core-racs\r\n[5] https://github.com/purien/TLS-SE\r\n[6] https://github.com/purien/IoSE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLe sam. 13 juil. 2024 à 01:22, Liz Flynn <lflynn@amsl.com> a écrit :\r\n\r\n> Do you have an idea, problem space, or proposal that IETFers and IRTFers\r\n> should hear about?\r\n>\r\n> Do you want to propose IETF or IRTF work but aren’t sure if your idea is\r\n> ready or who else will be interested?\r\n>\r\n> Agenda requests are now being accepted for the Request for Conversation\r\n> (HotRFC) lightning talk session.

Past HotRFC lightning talks have covered a broad range of purposes, including:\r\n\r\nCollaboration: proposals for new standards work or new research topics that haven't been discussed elsewhere, potentially relevant research that may be ready for the IETF\r\nNotification: new topics on the agenda in a BOF, working group or research group, especially cross-area IETF work\r\nEnlightenment: updates on relevant technologies, industry advances that could affect IETF participants.\r\n\r\nWith strict time limits, concise talks will give viewers a sense of whether they’d like to know more and, importantly, coordinates on how to do so.\r\n\r\nWith the current hybrid IETF meeting format, we’re going to keep things simple and permit only live presentations, either on-site or remote via MeetEcho. Slides must be submitted in advance. \r\n\r\nTo request a slot, submit a short abstract to hotrfc@ietf.org no later than Friday, 2024-07-19, 2400 local meeting time that includes the following:\r\n\r\nTalk title\r\nPresenter, Affiliation, and whether you’ll be presenting in person or remotely\r\nShort topic abstract (topics should be IETF- or IRTF-related in some way)\r\nWhat you're looking for (education, collaborators, implementers, etc.)\r\nCoordinates to learn more, contact those involved, participate in existing mailing lists and scheduled meetings, and/or relevant formal or side meetings.\r\nAny relevant drafts or helpful resources you’d like collaborators to look at\r\nTo provide slides, submit ppt or pdf to hotrfc@ietf.org <mailto:hotrfc@ietf.org> no later than Saturday, 2024-07-20, 2400 local meeting time.\r\n\r\nTalk abstracts and slides will be posted on the meeting agenda.

With\r\nInternet applications, we are not in a situation in which the\r\nexistence of one application blocks the introduction of another.\r\nThe very fact that plausible replacements -- with similar or a\r\nsuperset of the functionality of the original -- have not emerged,\r\ngotten traction, and been standardized, actually suggests that the\r\nold application is adequate.  It could, of course, also suggest\r\neither of two other things: \r\n\r\n * that no one cares.  In that case moving something to\r\n\tHistoric will not do a thing to promote the introduction of\r\n\treplacements.\r\n * that the IETF is sufficiently broken that new work that is\r\n\tclearly needed, with people (not just one or two enthusiasts)\r\n\tready to do the work, is being discouraged or blocked\r\n\tsomehow.  In that case, whether FTP and/or Telnet are make\r\n\tHistoric or not is the least of our problems.\r\n\r\nTo respond quickly to a couple of other comments:\r\n\r\n * I hope and assume Brian was joking, but... Unless we intend\r\n\tto create a new division of the Protocol Police, with Global,\r\n\tmaybe interplanetary, enforcement authority and mechanisms to\r\n\timmediately disconnect or imprison any user who dares to try\r\n\tto use the protocol and to fine any developer who dares to\r\n\tincluding a Telnet client or interface in its offerings,\r\n\tmaking Telnet historic would not get port 23 back.  Instead,\r\n\tit would create serious interoperability problems as soon as\r\n\tsomething else tried to use that port for another purpose.\r\n * Unless it were updated/extended to be strictly\r\n\tforward-compatible (including supporting any option\r\n\tnegotiation than anyone in the world was using), promoting\r\n\tSSH to Internet Standard has little or nothing to do with\r\n\tthis (even though it is probably overdue, especially if it\r\n\tbrought us a consolidate document).  People who are happy\r\n\twith Telnet and can find it will keep using Telnet.  People\r\n\twho understand the advantages of SSH or who find accessing it\r\n\tmore convenient will use SSH, just like they do today.  The\r\n\tIETF doesn't have much influence there either, certainly not\r\n\twith an established and well-documented protocol.\r\n\r\nConstructive suggestion for anyone who wants to see FTP and/or Telnet\r\ngo away: draft an Applicability Statement that carefully explains the\r\nissues and risks with those protocols, possibly explores where they\r\nare and are not supported, and discusses and recommends some\r\nalternatives.  Such a document might get some traction and be helpful\r\nwhere changing of labels (such as reclassifying Internet Standards to\r\nHistoric) would not.  Looking at the situation a different way, the\r\nsame explanation and document content would (or should be) a\r\nprerequisite changing the status of Internet Standards that are still\r\nin use, even for marginal cases, to Historic (or much of anything\r\nelse).\r\n\r\n   john\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

From a security\r\nstandpoint, it sort of depends on what one cares about and how much.\r\nDo you trust the cloud provider, its security mechanisms, etc., more\r\nthan you trust what can be provided locally?  If one cares about\r\nrecords of who is accessing which files, are they more concerned\r\nabout the cloud provider's mechanisms and staff or about the\r\npossibility of someone compromising ISPs and intercepting and\r\ninterpreting the traffic?  If neither party cares whether opponents\r\nor would be attackers know that Y is a client of X (or have some\r\nother relationship) that changes the security/privacy equation as\r\nwell.  It is important to remember that most decisions about using\r\nare typically insensitive to whatever we might believe about what\r\nsorts of behavior we would consider rational or optimal (even if we\r\ncould agree); they are only about what those users or user groups\r\nbelieve.\r\n\r\nRelative to my comments about an FTP user community, another piece of\r\nthe puzzle is that their exchanges are typically not about some\r\nsemi-random Alice wanting to get a single file to an equally random\r\nBob.  They are about established relationships in which multiple\r\nfiles will be transferred over time and in both directions.  In their\r\nsituations, no one is sending credentials by email or relying on some\r\nflavor of opportunistic encryption so weakness in those mechanisms\r\nare irrelevant.  I have not dug into many of the cases, but in at\r\nleast a few, the process starts with in-person contacts in which USB\r\nsticks with credentials (and, if necessary, software) can be passed\r\nfrom hand to hand or, perhaps, put in the post with some sort of\r\ntamper-evident packaging.  Whatever we might think of it, some of\r\nthose folks also believe that using telephones to exchange\r\ninformation like keys or other security credentials is far safer than\r\nanything that they believe involves the Internet.  And, again, it is\r\nnot about what we know (or claim we do), only about what they they\r\nbelieve.\r\n \r\n> I still believe that for most users on the Internet, for the vast\r\n> majority of cases, FTP is no longer the best answer for sharing\r\n> files.

I can't get to\r\nmaking it historic... at least unless we define \"historic\" as \"the\r\nIETF no longer cares about it\".  Otherwise, I'd like to reserve\r\n\"historic\" for protocols for which there are no longer any active\r\nusers or uses; which will simply not work on the contemporary\r\nInternet; or for which there is very broad (not just rough) consensus\r\nthat they been superceded by other work with either equivalent or\r\nsuperset functionality.  The \"not work\" criteria do not include our\r\nopinions about how much security and/or privacy people should want or\r\nneed.\r\n\r\nAs an exercise, would you encourage moving TELNET to Historic\r\n(presumably bringing all of the work on environments, authentication,\r\nand encryption done in the 1990s and early 2000s along with it) or\r\ndeprecating it for general use?   For most users and the vast\r\nmajority of cases, it has been superceded by SSH. The only major uses\r\nI'm aware of (and I'm one of the users) lie in simulating protocols\r\nlike SMTP and HTTP for debugging purposes and for running scripts\r\nthat provide more FTP functionality than is easily captured in a\r\nfairly simple, single-flle or wildcard, URI.  Or, picking up on your\r\ncomment below, do we need a BOF about Telnet++?\r\n\r\n> I do agree to the point about sharing files over various HTTP based\r\n> services being bespoke.  Perhaps someone should plan a BOF to do an\r\n> FTP++ (whatever that looks like) to try and bring file sharing in\r\n> to the 21st century and have a common solution?\r\n\r\nThis is where my pessimism overcomes my desires and inclination.  I\r\nsee so much hostility toward FTP that I think such a BOF would\r\nrapidly deteriorate into claims that the work is useless because the\r\nweb is better in any possible respect than FTP or any plausible\r\noffspring.  I don't know if I would expect more or less hostility if\r\nit were to include one or more of scp, sftp, or even rsync into the\r\nspace of \"should be a common solution\" but that would not help with\r\nhaving a productive BOF either.  In addition, such a BOF would be a\r\nwaste of time unless there were an AD who would be willing to take\r\nthe work on and form a WG if the BOF recommended that and an IESG\r\nthat would be willing to take FTP-derived work seriously.  At the\r\nrisk of a segue into another recent controversial discussion, would\r\nthe IESG be willing to back a BOF or WG chair or list administrator\r\nwho started kicking people out who did nothing but repeat themselves\r\nabout how much better it would be to do things over the web and/or\r\ncloud.   I don't see any, much less all, of those conditions being\r\nmet.  \r\n\r\nMaybe the IETF could do better for the Internet and FTP and other\r\npre-web application protocols, including the development of 21st\r\ncentury derivations, by explicitly declaring disinterest and thereby\r\nencouraging the development of an Old Protocols Consortium to look\r\nafter them.  Even then, I would not predict adoption by most of the\r\nactive FTP users I'm seeing.  I think an old adage from what we now\r\ncall the UI/UX community might apply: \"what you already know is\r\nbetter\".  I.e., don't expect us to learn new stuff when what we have\r\nbeen using meets our perceived needs.\r\n\r\nIf I believed in FTP++ and the IETF, I'd put together an I-D\r\ndiscussing the strengths and weaknesses of FTP and possibly\r\napproaches that might remedy some of the latter.  Then I'd see what\r\nsort of response I got and if it could be used as a foundation for\r\nthe BOF you suggest.   If nothing else, I think the odds of getting\r\nsuch a BOF would be much better if there were a starting point\r\ndocument.  I wouldn't have time even if I were less pessimistic.\r\nDave?

And the corporate world responded with initiatives like\r\nthe Jericoh Forum which talked about 'Deperimeterization' but entirely\r\nfailed to influence because they presented deperimeterization as something\r\nthey wanted to happen rather than something which would inevitably happen\r\nand people needed to be ready for.\r\n\r\nAnd now they are pushing 'Zero-Trust' which is essentially the same set of\r\nideas but with the cloud added. And this is even worse because 'zero' trust\r\nis impossible. You are always going to put some degree of trust into every\r\nservice provider and every employee. The real issue is MANAGING trust and\r\nminimizing the number of parties you trust and the degree to which you\r\ntrust each one. Once people say the objective is ZERO, they have cut\r\nthemselves off from all the tools they need like separation of duties.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons I want to rationalize and simplify the architecture is\r\nso we can impose strong controls. So I buy a coffee pot, today it has\r\nunlimited access but only to my local net. Which is better than unlimited\r\naccess to the whole Internet and being infected with a virus and trying to\r\nDDoS the root DNS servers like the nanny cams did.\r\n\r\nBut my ideal is that I unpack the coffee pot, I scan a barcode on the\r\nbottom, it is now connected to my network and I can tell it to warm up so I\r\ncan make coffee any time I like. But the coffee pot is on an isolated\r\nvirtual network and cannot see ANY OTHER device on the network except for\r\nthe pair of IoT gateways that manage communication with it.\r\n\r\nIn my model the coffee pot has the absolute least privilege required to\r\nperform its function and it doesn't even know who owns it. It doesn't know\r\nif it is sitting in my house or the break room at the NSA.\r\n\r\n\r\nBack when I was working on the security of the email publication system MIT\r\nAI built for the Clinton EOP, they wanted to install a DEC AI tool that\r\nscanned the net for anomalous behaviors. So I tried it out and it turned\r\nout to be pretty sucky. I was in the AI lab after all. It might be possible\r\nto make that approach work. But surely the first step is to know what is\r\nconnected to the network and what the range of functions it requires\r\nactually is. Having devices declare their functions seems a lot more\r\nreliable than guessing.\r\n",

    "body": "Jason,\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that \"move the needle\" may be the wrong criterion.  As\r\nseveral of us have commented in different ways, the most important\r\nthing is that the IETF be seen as seriously trying to get support for\r\nIPv6 in its work and operations.  In that regard, tuning RFPs as\r\nvarious people have suggested is good.  Trying to get M3AAWG on board\r\nwould be good too.  If we can figure out other ways to try to push\r\npeople toward supporting IPv6 for our tools and operations, that\r\nwould be good too.  \r\n\r\nThat part of this issue has just about zero to do with our\r\nexpectations of success.  It is much closer to \"can't hurt to try and\r\nthere are some advantages to doing so\".  The only argument I can see\r\nagainst going down that path would be if IPv6 were so seriously\r\nbroken as a means of supporting a particular application that we\r\nwould risk suffering public embarrassment from the responses.  As\r\nothers have pointed out, including at the running code level, there\r\nis little risk of that.\r\n\r\nTo make that issue a bit more concrete, suppose you (in your LLC\r\nBoard capacity), Jay, Roman, or Tommy found yourselves in a public,\r\nnon-IETF forum and were asked what it means for IPv6 that the IETF is\r\nnot supporting it for its own email.  Pick between the following\r\nanswers in terms of what you would rather say and what you would\r\nrather have the audience hear:\r\n\r\n(1) \"The IETF has made a good faith effort to get IPv6 support for\r\nthose tools and operations, including writing a strong preference\r\nclause into RFPs and intervening with multiple organizations.\r\nHowever, the LLC has determined that, for operational reasons\r\nincluding what is practically available in the marketplace, insisting\r\non it would impede the IETF's ability to do its work.\"\r\n\r\n(2) \"None of the vendors whom we considered plausible sources of the\r\nrelevant support services provide IPv6 so we decided we didn't care.\"\r\n\r\nNow perhaps the second is a little more extreme than necessary\r\n(although some comments have, IMO, come close).  And I am confident\r\nthat you, Jay, and legal counsel if necessary could do better with\r\nthe first.

    "body": "Hi Michael,\r\n\r\nTo add to what Paul said, and give some more context – the Alldispatch chairs have been working really hard to have an early Alldispatch agenda, with a strict timeline and repeated early call for topics and deadlines. That was one of the comments coming up over and over from the V1 of the experiment at IETF 119: the meeting time is valuable, let’s make sure it is well used and planned well in advance. When the IESG was doing the de-conflicting, all the topics in the agenda were GEN, so what Paul said, it made sense to allow for other sessions that really needed deconflicting to run in parallel (given the amount of conflicts we have to handle). Now a couple of requests have come in (after deadline) which are not GEN. It is unfortunate, but we didn’t have this data when looking at deconflicting. The amount of conflicts we get and what can we do about it is something else we should talk about…\r\n\r\nFrancesca\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: Paul Wouters <paul@nohats.ca>\r\nDate: Thursday, 4 July 2024 at 13:37\r\nTo: alldispatch@ietf.org <alldispatch@ietf.org>\r\nCc: ietf@ietf.org <ietf@ietf.org>\r\nSubject: [Alldispatch] Re: alldispatch conflicts\r\nOn Jul 3, 2024, at 18:57, Michael Richardson <mcr+ietf@sandelman.ca> wrote:\r\n>\r\n> ﻿\r\n> I see in the final agenda that alldispatch is no longer in total plenary\r\n> mode.

    "body": "When RFC 6540 was written 12 years ago it was reasonable to expect that\r\nmany services didn't yet support IPv6 and that the IETF lacked the\r\npurchasing power to convince vendors to make changes.  However in 2024\r\nwe've had a decade of major governments and corporations including IPv6\r\nsupport requirements in RFPs.  We still have another decade or more of many\r\nvendors having a long tail of features still catching up with IPv6 support,\r\nbut lacking IPv6 should be considered a bug at this point.  We're at the\r\nleading edge where it's reasonable to build certain classes of applications\r\nas IPv6-only (sometimes needing some IPv4 transition mechanism, but wanting\r\nto keep use of that to a minimum).\r\n\r\nIn that context, it seems reasonable for the IETF to have a reference\r\nto RFC 6540 in all RFPs and to have supporting both IPv6 and IPv4 as a MUST.\r\nHaving an exception process may be necessary but hopefully rare, should be\r\ntied to no other options being available, and should be tied to a concrete\r\nplan and roadmap from the vendor for addressing.\r\n\r\nGithub is one clear exception we've had for awhile, and this is painful to\r\nmany people in the community as it is a roadblock to IPv6-only services.\r\nIndications are that progress is being made there to dual-stack, and it\r\nwould be nice to avoid further regressions.\r\n\r\nBut either way, I agree this is an area where the IETF needs explicit\r\nclarity and policy rather than just periodic mailing list discussions.\r\n\r\n    Erik\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n>\r\n",

Lead among them.\r\n\r\nIt is relatively easy to set up and run at least a minimal FTP\r\nserver.  If the content of files being shared are sensitive, having\r\nthose files encrypted before being made available to the server is\r\nperceived by those who have taken the FTP path as safer than having\r\nthem encrypted only in transit.   By contrast, there is a widely held\r\nperception that setting up and operating web services has become\r\ndifficult and complex enough that more organizations are better off\r\ncontracting those out.   The latter can quickly lead to questions\r\nabout whether one trusts the contractor (usually a cloud provider)\r\nand their staff.  Those questions are different from whether they do\r\na good enough job of following IETF protocols and recommendations\r\nabout protecting data in transit and/or information about who is\r\naccessing what sites and data repositories.\r\n\r\nIf Keith wanted to get a file from me that was too large to easily\r\ntransmit as an email attachment, and and I wanted to let him, FTP\r\nwould still be the easiest --and, by many definitions, the most\r\nsecure-- way to do that.  It would require that we not care very much\r\nwhether someone with access to sniff our ISPs or the backbone could\r\nfind out that we talk with each other, or even how we name our files,\r\nbut they certainly would not learn anything profound.\r\n\r\nIf one needs the latter, it may drive data providers in certain\r\ndirections.  If not, it looks like a lot of unnecessary complexity,\r\nthings that are hard for non-experts to understand, and things that\r\nmight go wrong.  A (at least implicit) design maxim for the early\r\nARPANET and Internet, especially at the applications layer, was that\r\nsimplicity was good.  It led to more implementations, more\r\ninteroperability, and fewer bugs, bugs that could create their own\r\nrisks and problems.  I remember criticisms of early FTP that it was\r\ntoo complex and that one important early implementation did not\r\nsupport many of its features and options.  Arguably, HTTP 1.0 and 1.1\r\nwere less complex than FTP (and built on the same general model).\r\nToday, if complexity is a concern and we look at HTTPS in practice...\r\nmuch worse.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure whether, like Keith, I see the current state of things\r\nas the IETF's fault or, e.g., the IETF as, like many other things, a\r\nvictim of a series of other forces.  But unless the conclusion is\r\nthat the IETF is making itself irrelevant, I'm not sure how much\r\ndifference it makes.\r\n\r\n  john\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The issue\r\nis _not_ IPv6 (+- some of the v6 issues you tend to have with hosters,\r\nincluding putting too many hosts into too small prefixes, not\r\nenabling/setting rDNS etc.); \r\n\r\nInstead, the problem here is Google's (and not only their; and not only\r\nfor IPv6) behavior as a market controlling entity; Which, again--makes\r\nsense--given the scale they are operating at. The necessary cattle\r\napproach just requires making some things the same that are not (for my\r\nwhole complaint about all of that I recommend my talk on the topic: \r\nhttps://ripe85.ripe.net/archives/video/877/ ).\r\n\r\n_I_ have no issues delivering mails via IPv6 to Gmail; All you have to\r\ndo is having a 10y+ good reputation for the associated v4 addresses,\r\nwithout _any_ other spam coming from the same netblocks (or having come\r\nthere for the past decade), best ensured by not having _anyone else_\r\nthere; Of course, the netbloock should be your own as well, so better\r\nget in line with your local RIR; And of course, fcRDNS, SPF, DKIM,\r\nDMARC, [...] You see, extremely simple to do and very certainly only a\r\nmatter of competence and absolutely not of 'having made specific\r\nchoices by pure chance, like clicking IPv4 PI over a decade ago'. \r\n\r\nAh, and slip up once, your mails 'disappear' again. Maybe for a day.\r\nMaybe for a week. Maybe you never find out. Until you meet someone at a\r\nconference, who asks 'why did you never reply to my email'.\r\n\r\nAnd in that sense... maybe it might be best to support IPv6 for IETF\r\nmailinglist; Well, at least for delivery to @google.com addresses (and\r\nmaybe a couple more, including @microsoft.com); Exclusively. That might\r\nactually have some adoption encouraging implications...\r\n\r\nWith best regards,\r\nTobias\r\n\r\n",

The people I've heard from want, for reasons I at least\r\nhinted at, nothing to do with VPS setups.  They are running their own\r\nservers on their own premises.  That may make them hopelessly\r\nbackward, but that is how it is. Since they are sending or receiving\r\nencrypted files, either their servers are set up to default to TYPE I\r\nor it is built into the scripts.  \r\n\r\nI also thought the comment and the fact that those users and uses\r\nexisted might be of interest given the discussion Dave and Keith were\r\nhaving.  Because they are happy with what they are doing and believe\r\n--correctly or not-- that FTP provides them advantages over using the\r\nweb, they are unlikely to be persuaded by IETF telling them that the\r\nweb is better.  Were the IETF to deprecate FTP entirely, the only\r\neffect on them would be to lower their opinion of the IETF and its\r\ncredibility.  And, if their operating systems somehow stopped\r\nsupporting FTP, even partially at IETF's behest, they would either\r\ndecide to not upgrade (making the Internet worse if those upgrades\r\nsupported other important features) or would change to something that\r\ndid... and their opinion of the IETF would go down even further.\r\n\r\nAs I also indicated, they don't see a need for encryption on their\r\nFTP servers because (1) they are encrypting the files themselves and\r\nconsider that to be safer and less dependent on others than encrypted\r\nconnections and (2) after whatever analysis they have run and\r\ntradeoffs they have considered, they and those who might connect to\r\nthem don't care whether someone compromises an ISP sufficiently to\r\nexpose who is making connections and what files are being\r\ntransferred.   Even if someone manages to capture a user ID and\r\npassword, they don't care because, again, the files themselves are\r\nstrongly encrypted.  Their biggest concerns in that regard is the\r\npossibility of DoS attacks but most VPS setups don't offer a lot of\r\nprotection against those either.\r\n\r\nIf this is going to turn into a discussion of why the web is better\r\nor why they are making bad choices, I want to drop out of it right\r\nnow as a likely waste of time.  As I say, they aren't interested and\r\nI'm probably not either.\r\n\r\n    john\r\n\r\n",

Lead among them.\r\n\r\nIt is relatively easy to set up and run at least a minimal FTP\r\nserver.  If the content of files being shared are sensitive, having\r\nthose files encrypted before being made available to the server is\r\nperceived by those who have taken the FTP path as safer than having\r\nthem encrypted only in transit.   By contrast, there is a widely held\r\nperception that setting up and operating web services has become\r\ndifficult and complex enough that more organizations are better off\r\ncontracting those out.   The latter can quickly lead to questions\r\nabout whether one trusts the contractor (usually a cloud provider)\r\nand their staff.  Those questions are different from whether they do\r\na good enough job of following IETF protocols and recommendations\r\nabout protecting data in transit and/or information about who is\r\naccessing what sites and data repositories. \r\n\r\nIf Keith wanted to get a file from me that was too large to easily\r\ntransmit as an email attachment, and and I wanted to let him, FTP\r\nwould still be the easiest --and, by many definitions, the most\r\nsecure-- way to do that.  It would require that we not care very much\r\nwhether someone with access to sniff our ISPs or the backbone could\r\nfind out that we talk with each other, or even how we name our files,\r\nbut they certainly would not learn anything profound.  \r\n\r\nIf one needs the latter, it may drive data providers in certain\r\ndirections.  If not, it looks like a lot of unnecessary complexity,\r\nthings that are hard for non-experts to understand, and things that\r\nmight go wrong.  A (at least implicit) design maxim for the early\r\nARPANET and Internet, especially at the applications layer, was that\r\nsimplicity was good.  It led to more implementations, more\r\ninteroperability, and fewer bugs, bugs that could create their own\r\nrisks and problems.  I remember criticisms of early FTP that it was\r\ntoo complex and that one important early implementation did not\r\nsupport many of its features and options.  Arguably, HTTP 1.0 and 1.1\r\nwere less complex than FTP (and built on the same general model).\r\nToday, if complexity is a concern and we look at HTTPS in practice...\r\nmuch worse.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure whether, like Keith, I see the current state of things\r\nas the IETF's fault or, e.g., the IETF as, like many other things, a\r\nvictim of a series of other forces.  But unless the conclusion is\r\nthat the IETF is making itself irrelevant, I'm not sure how much\r\ndifference it makes.\r\n\r\n  john\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

And that counts for\r\nsomething. Even if they do not make sense from afar.  There is a \r\nsplit view here, and it needs to be acknowledged.\r\n\r\nMy personal belief is that it probably could have been done dual-stack,\r\nbut I fully respect the decisions made by people doing work --\r\nconsiderably more than I do the opinions of  those who watch and know\r\nhow it should be done... (including myself) \r\n\r\n( Side discussion: There is another underlying problem that's probably\r\n  lead to the decision, and I think this is where the research community\r\n  could contribute: Email is becoming conduits between walled gardens.\r\n  Stopping this is -- I feel -- a very important thing for the Internet,\r\n  and thus, the IETF.  ) \r\n\r\n> At a principled level, I agree that if the community says \"we must have\r\n> IPv6 for mail\" then the LLC needs to deliver that, but at a practical\r\n> level, given the cost and effort required, I would want that conveyed in\r\n> a more formal way than a discussion on this list and us given a year plus\r\n> to deliver it.

While wireless connections are\r\nessentially wonderous magic, they also fade in and out, and devices might\r\nuse 4 (or more) Gs in between Access Points, and different Access Points\r\nmight not be on the same network (or preserve the IP address even when they\r\nare or preserve the NAT data even when they do).\r\n\r\nMuch of the reason why TCP sessions typically don't outlast the physical\r\nconnectivity is because we've got ourselves used to this, and designed\r\nprotocols accordingly. Those of us who've spent a long time on protocols\r\nlike IMAP and XMPP, which benefit from lengthy connections and don't rely\r\non mobile push services to paper the cracks, have hit these problems quite\r\na bit (see QRESYNC, XEP-0198, XEP-0388 - honestly it forms the bulk of my\r\naimless scribbling).\r\n\r\nIn addition, we end up with wasteful network traffic that is only there to\r\ndefeat NAT timeouts, with application-level pings and keepalives.\r\n\r\nAs Mans says, this is a significant feedback loop, and many developers have\r\nsimply never experienced this due to the many layers of workaround we\r\ntypically employ, which is why you now see things like JMAP arriving, which\r\n- inter alia - switches to HTTP because nothing else works anymore, and\r\nmoreover, hosting at places like AWS is significantly easier and cheaper to\r\ndo if all you want to do is base-level HTTP/1.1 (they may provide an HTTP/2\r\nor HTTP/3 load balancer, but they'll talk to you only using HTTP/1.1).\r\n\r\nWhat's fun is that this in turn means that we have efforts trying to\r\nrebuild TCP-like functionality into HTTP (Websockets, WebTrans, etc) but\r\nthese are unlikely to take off either, because they, like TLS, will be\r\nterminated at the load balancer.\r\n\r\nIn turn, any unilateral flow of data from a service to a consumer - what we\r\nnow call \"push\" - ends up being transported entirely out of band via the\r\nconsumer device manufacturer's system. Luckily this is mentioned aloud\r\nwithin the IETF only with hushed mumbling, otherwise we might have to\r\nconsider the privacy effects this has, because every datagram over push\r\nseems to contain the device and service. The only thing worse would be\r\ncentralising all DNS queries to a handful of huge providers, but luckily\r\nnobody would ever allow that to happen, especially not the same providers\r\nas the mobile push ones.\r\n\r\nThis, of course, leads directly into your comments on architecture (or the\r\nlack of it), which I will respond to separately if I can work up the\r\nenergy...\r\n\r\n> [*] then again, I remember times when I'd routinely keep FTP sessions up\r\n> for well over 24 hours, and I don't see why that's not still reasonable.\r\n>\r\nMostly it's unreasonable because it's FTP, which is rather like using\r\nTOPS-20.

[*]  But this is because it's far more \r\nlikely that at least one of the endpoints will be nomadic, as it is that \r\nthe network itself will need to change addresses of one or more endpoints.\r\n\r\nI think you're mixing lots of different things.    The problems with \r\nNATs are well known by now and aren't limited to the fact that the IP \r\naddresses change between the endpoints.   In short they make \r\napplications much less reliable and more expensive to operate than \r\nnecessary.   But even in a network with universal global addressing and \r\nno NATs and addresses kept the same end-to-end, some of those problems \r\nwould still exist, due to mobility and middleboxes at least.   That's \r\nnot an argument in favor of NATs.\r\n\r\n>\r\n> Architecture is a dynamic concept, not something that is static.

That \r\ndoesn't mean that it cannot evolve over time, but it shouldn't happen \r\naccidentally.\r\n\r\nIn many ways IETF (including IAB) has failed to maintain the Internet \r\narchitecture and respond to changing conditions, with the result that \r\nthe Internet is currently unpredictable to a large degree, and this \r\nharms the ability of the Internet to support applications and users.   I \r\nthink this happened because IETF wants to treat everything like a \r\nworking group, and working groups (especially siloed working groups) \r\naren't a good structure for making architectural decisions.   Also, it's \r\nwidely (and correctly) understood that architectural decisions can be \r\nshortsighted, so rather than take the risk of making poor architectural \r\ndecisions, people have just thrown up their hands and given up.  I'm not \r\nsure how to solve this problem with IETF, but the lack of direction and \r\nforesight for the Internet architecture are really starting to show.\r\n\r\nTaking this specific example, if the best way that receiver SMTPs have \r\nto determine a sender's reputation involves looking at the source IP \r\naddress, when we've known for pretty much the entire history of the \r\nInternet that this would never work well at scale, but we haven't \r\naddressed the problem yet in any significant way, ...   NATs only made \r\nthis problem worse, but the problem has always been lurking waiting to \r\nbite us.\r\n\r\nKeith\r\n\r\n[*] then again, I remember times when I'd routinely keep FTP sessions up \r\nfor well over 24 hours, and I don't see why that's not still reasonable.\r\n",

It is smaller because it is recommended to give /56 to every smartphone, and a draft is at WGLC to give /64 per every virtual or physical host (the \"+\" in 64+bits would be canceled - it would be strictly 64bit Architecture).\r\n\r\nHence, it is not 400 years as somebody calculated (for 128bits) because the address space is about 2^56 (not 2^128) and shrinking. IETF has so many ideas on how to abuse so many bits.\r\nIt is an IETF \"consensus\", hence, you should enjoy it.\r\nEd/\r\n-----Original Message-----\r\nFrom: John Levine <johnl@taugh.com> \r\nSent: Tuesday, July 2, 2024 18:13\r\nTo: ietf@ietf.org\r\nSubject: Re: why IPv6 is bad, No, SMTP is IPv4, Was: SMTP and IPv6\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr. Neal Krawetz  <ietf@hackerfactor.com>:\r\n>Every big corporation I've seen uses the same choke-point configuration:\r\n>  - All outbound traffic goes through a very small number of IPv4 addresses for egress filter and incoming firewall protection.\r\n>  - Every internal-only computer uses globally routable IPv4 addresses.\r\n>\r\n>They *should* be using NAT!\r\n\r\nAn interesting argument, not totally ridiculous.\r\n\r\n>The way IPv6 is being allocated?

With IPv6, you still have to wait for neighbor \r\n>discovery to complete. You might think everything is configured correctly but see that it isn't working for the first few seconds (or minutes). When IPv6 isn't ready when you're ready, you assume it isn't working and fall back to IPv4 which is immediately on.\r\n\r\nThose are reasonable.  I suppose you could speed things up with DHCPv6 but it seems to be fast enough as is for most purppses.\r\n\r\n>  - Firewalls: That whole configuration issue, where corporations have \r\n>everything route through a single egress filter/firewall service? IPv6 \r\n>wants direct access and doesn't support NAT. (Is there such a thing as NATv6? Does anyone use it?) This means that IPv6 has the potential of creating a security nightmare by giving internal-only systems bidirectional access to the internet.  Even for a residential service, my home IoT devices should never have their own direct connection to the internet. Without the correct configuration, IPv6 is much worse than UPnP.\r\n\r\nThere is NATv6 but it's not widely used. It is not hard to set up an\r\nIPv6 firewall with the same kind of protection you normally get from NAT. I've done it. But it's not ths same as NAT so I suppose it seems harder.\r\n\r\nTo me the main issues are that it's different, so it has a learning curve, and for the vast majority of users IPv6 still offers no practical benefit.\r\n\r\nR's,\r\nJohn\r\n--\r\nRegards,\r\nJohn Levine, johnl@taugh.com, Primary Perpetrator of \"The Internet for Dummies\", Please consider the environment before reading this e-mail. https://jl.ly\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Hi Jay,\r\n\r\nMay be it was a problem of miscommunication (some years ago, not now), about the lack of mandatory IPv6 support in all the services. At least, from my side I understood that, not sure if other have been in the same page. If there was not an explicit policy about it, we clearly must have it ASAP.\r\n\r\nRegarding the mail with IPv6, we have got it for several years from AMS, right? I haven’t perceived that it failed, in the sense that it was working well, and there was not an excessive amount of spam vs other organizations mail systems. So it was really much more expensive than in Amazon? or what was the reason to switch it to Amazon? May be it was not because the email but because it was part of an RFP with many other components (just thinking that was the reason, not sure about it)? Then it may be sensible to split the RFP in the future.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nJordi\r\n\r\n@jordipalet\r\n\r\n\r\n> El 2 jul 2024, a las 6:24, Jay Daley <exec-director@ietf.org> escribió:\r\n> \r\n> (Sorry for this response taking so long - I was way last week)\r\n> \r\n> From reading the various threads, there are four substantive points for me to address:\r\n> \r\n> 1.  Communications\r\n> I agree that our communication around the mail migration has not been good enough and I apologise for that.  We have put new processes in place to ensure that we are communicating with more details and in a more timely fashion, and so this will improve going forward.\r\n> \r\n> 2.  Consulting on specific changes\r\n> We have been engaged in a major infrastructure migration project for several months now, which follows a year and half of discussions to agree a new strategy for infrastructure management, all of which took place on tools-discuss@ietf.org and in the monthly tools calls. In any project of this scale and complexity, there’s a balance between getting on and delivering that strategy, and consulting on individual decisions as part of that.  We currently manage that balance through holding monthly tools calls with a detailed agenda and the LLC tools people and key contractors in attendance [1]. Unfortunately, we’ve had limited community participation in those meetings, those that have participated have been supportive and we have therefore been caught out here.   (That’s not to criticise those who have participated- their views have been very welcome).\r\n> \r\n> As things stand, I don’t see a better way to manage that balance.  A pre-emptive issue-specific consultation mechanism would take too long and, given the likely spread of views, would not provide a clear path forwards.  To put it directly - if anyone wants to review/support/influence the migration project then they should either join those calls or read the agenda when posted and provide comment on the tools-discuss list.  \r\n> \r\n> 3.  IPv6 for mail\r\n> As others have explained, we have chosen to switch, at this stage, to a large commercial mail sender with extensive reputation management rather than continue to send directly and as a consequence that will be IPv4 only.  I don’t plan to reiterate the multiple trade-offs considered in that decision, but I do want to stress that this was not a simple decision.  I say \"at this stage\" because there are still discussions about whether or not this is the best long term strategy for mail delivery.\r\n> \r\n> At a principled level, I agree that if the community says \"we must have IPv6 for mail\" then the LLC needs to deliver that, but at a practical level, given the cost and effort required, I would want that conveyed in a more formal way than a discussion on this list and us given a year plus to deliver it.  However, and this is major however, piecemeal decisions like that are only going to make things much harder and it would be much better to have a broader decision about IPv6 in IETF services (more on that below).  \r\n> \r\n> For now at least then, we are going to continue with the plan to move to Amazon SES for mail sending.  Once that is bedded down, that will be reviewed, but that will be several months away and the outcome may be to stick with it, unless there has been a community decision that changes that.\r\n> \r\n> 4.  IPv6 for all services (or not)\r\n> If the community wants to develop guidance on the use of IPv6 for IETF services then that would be helpful.  More generally, it would be so much better all round, if the implicit expectations that people have about IETF services, were properly surfaced, discussed, agreed and recorded.  If that were done, then we would be very happy to include those in any RFP or service assessment.\r\n> \r\n> Jay\r\n> \r\n> [1]  https://notes.ietf.org/tools-team-20240611 for the most recent\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> -- \r\n> Jay Daley\r\n> IETF Executive Director\r\n> exec-director@ietf.org\r\n> \r\n\r\n\r\n**********************************************\r\nIPv4 is over\r\nAre you ready for the new Internet ?\r\nhttp://www.theipv6company.com\r\nThe IPv6 Company\r\n\r\nThis electronic message contains information which may be privileged or confidential.

    "body": "I agree with Ed.\r\n\r\nIMNSHO, the \"not enough addresses\" problem with IPv4 was not due to having too few addresses. Rather, it was due to misallocation. When Hewlett-Packard's 100,000 employees had more IPv4 addresses than all of Brazil (HP owned Net15 and Net16), you know there was an allocation problem. (Today, HP gave up their two /8 ranges for a bunch of /18 - /24  subnets that might be still more than Brazil.)\r\n\r\nEvery big corporation I've seen uses the same choke-point configuration:\r\n  - All outbound traffic goes through a very small number of IPv4 addresses for egress filter and incoming firewall protection.\r\n  - Every internal-only computer uses globally routable IPv4 addresses.\r\n\r\nThey *should* be using NAT!\r\nA single /22 should be any big company that isn't a cloud provider. They should use Net10 or other private network ranges (RFC1819) for all internal-only addresses and use NAT for the outbound conversion.\r\n  - The outbound traffic still goes through a very small number of IPv4 addresses for firewall/filtering.\r\n  - Now a misconfigured system can't accidentally be routed over the internet.\r\n  - And they free up a ton of IPv4 addresses.\r\n\r\nThe way IPv6 is being allocated? Having \"more addresses than IPv4\" doesn't prevent the same misallocation problem. It just extends the time before we exhaust IPv6.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe biggest problems I'm seen that prevent IPv6 adoption:\r\n\r\n  - Complexity: IPv6 is more complicated than IPv4. If you go in with the \"IPv6 is like IPv4\" mentality, then the complexity will overwhelm you. I've seen way too many admins stick with IPv4 because IPv6 was too complicated.\r\n\r\n  - Startup time: With IPv4, you get your address, router, and subnet, and you're online.

Even for a residential service, my home IoT devices should never have their own direct connection to the internet. Without the correct configuration, IPv6 is much worse than UPnP.\r\n\r\n  - Speed: (This is the easiest problem to solve since it's just a perception issues.) People think \"IPv6 is bigger than IPV4 so it must be slower.\" Nope, IPv6 is faster because the packets are saner to parse. The next hard part is convincing them to increase the MTU for better throughput. (\"But everyone uses 1500!\" Nope, try 9000 for jumbo packets.)\r\n\r\n  - Hardware: \"Our hardware doesn't support IPv6.\" Sadly, some new hardware today STILL doesn't support IPv6. It should. Dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6) should be the norm, not the exception. If the hardware doesn't support IPv6, then it needs to be replaced. (The easiest counter-argument: look up all of the vulnerabilities in their old hardware and convince them that replacing it fixes these issues.)\r\n\r\nThere are likely other reasons that IPv6 still isn't more widely adopted. But in my experience, these are the big excuses I keep running into.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t-Neal\r\n--\r\nNeal Krawetz, Ph.D.\r\nHacker Factor Solutions\r\nhttps://hackerfactor.com/\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Tue, Jul 02, 2024 at 06:28:26AM +0000, Vasilenko Eduard wrote:\r\n> Just 1 problem: some ISPs are giving /56 to users.

We have put new processes in place to ensure that we are communicating with more details and in a more timely fashion, and so this will improve going forward.\r\n\r\n2.  Consulting on specific changes\r\nWe have been engaged in a major infrastructure migration project for several months now, which follows a year and half of discussions to agree a new strategy for infrastructure management, all of which took place on tools-discuss@ietf.org and in the monthly tools calls. In any project of this scale and complexity, there’s a balance between getting on and delivering that strategy, and consulting on individual decisions as part of that.  We currently manage that balance through holding monthly tools calls with a detailed agenda and the LLC tools people and key contractors in attendance [1]. Unfortunately, we’ve had limited community participation in those meetings, those that have participated have been supportive and we have therefore been caught out here.   (That’s not to criticise those who have participated- their views have been very welcome).\r\n\r\nAs things stand, I don’t see a better way to manage that balance.  A pre-emptive issue-specific consultation mechanism would take too long and, given the likely spread of views, would not provide a clear path forwards.  To put it directly - if anyone wants to review/support/influence the migration project then they should either join those calls or read the agenda when posted and provide comment on the tools-discuss list.  \r\n\r\n3.  IPv6 for mail\r\nAs others have explained, we have chosen to switch, at this stage, to a large commercial mail sender with extensive reputation management rather than continue to send directly and as a consequence that will be IPv4 only.  I don’t plan to reiterate the multiple trade-offs considered in that decision, but I do want to stress that this was not a simple decision.  I say \"at this stage\" because there are still discussions about whether or not this is the best long term strategy for mail delivery.\r\n\r\nAt a principled level, I agree that if the community says \"we must have IPv6 for mail\" then the LLC needs to deliver that, but at a practical level, given the cost and effort required, I would want that conveyed in a more formal way than a discussion on this list and us given a year plus to deliver it.  However, and this is major however, piecemeal decisions like that are only going to make things much harder and it would be much better to have a broader decision about IPv6 in IETF services (more on that below).  \r\n\r\nFor now at least then, we are going to continue with the plan to move to Amazon SES for mail sending.  Once that is bedded down, that will be reviewed, but that will be several months away and the outcome may be to stick with it, unless there has been a community decision that changes that.\r\n\r\n4.  IPv6 for all services (or not)\r\nIf the community wants to develop guidance on the use of IPv6 for IETF services then that would be helpful.  More generally, it would be so much better all round, if the implicit expectations that people have about IETF services, were properly surfaced, discussed, agreed and recorded.  If that were done, then we would be very happy to include those in any RFP or service assessment.\r\n\r\nJay\r\n\r\n[1]  https://notes.ietf.org/tools-team-20240611 for the most recent\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nJay Daley\r\nIETF Executive Director\r\nexec-director@ietf.org\r\n\r\n",

If 5% of email servers are IPv4 only, I have to support them or my deliverability will fail and I will get complaints. IPv4 addresses are not a scarce commodity as far as operators of mail services goes and so IPv4 will always be with us as far as SMTP is concerned.\r\n\r\nRemember BITNET?   I remember people insisting that BITNET would never disappear, people who were arguing that BITNET was still growing (if slowly) every month... right up until it disappeared almost overnight.\r\n\r\nBecause once everyone on BITNET had IP service, people realized it wasn't worth maintaining BITNET in addition to maintaining their IP networks.   This was true even though BITNET offered some services that didn't have direct IP equivalents.   (I believe many of those BITNET sites were actually transmitting that traffic over IP by then, so they had already saved the cost of the leased phone lines that they had once used.   It wasn't the communications cost so much as the administrative overhead that led to BITNET's demise.)\r\n\r\nSo I don't believe that IPv4 will always be with us, in any sense.   Once IPv6 access is ubiquitous, people will start asking why they need to continue administering IPv4, except perhaps to communicate locally with legacy devices.\r\n\r\nI'm actually in favor of explicitly deprecating the public IPv4 Internet, setting the date well in advance at which carriers start filtering IPv4 BGP advertisements and stop forwarding IPv4 traffic except by explicit arrangement.   I nominate Jan 1, 2033.   We need to stop insisting that sites must continue to administer two IP networks forever.\r\n\r\nKeith\r\n\r\n\r\n",

It is about whether, if\r\nsome organization is considering whether to move rapidly toward IPv6\r\nand asks the question \"what is the IETF doing with its own\r\ninfrastructure\", we want the answer to interpreted as \"the message\r\nfrom the IETF is that IPv6 is not really ready yet\".  IMO, even\r\nwithout evidence that a single would-be buyer of services applies\r\nthat test, the optics of the IETF not asking for IPv6 support are\r\nterrible and likely to have bad effects on our credibility as a\r\ndefiner and setter or standards.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the right way to thread that needle is similar or\r\nidentical to what David Farmer suggested [1]:\r\n\r\nRFPs should require IPv4 support and ask for IPv6 support.  A bidder\r\nmight reasonably respond with IPv4-only, IPv4 and IPv6, or IPv4 with\r\nIPv6 and some specific marginal cost.  As long as we can avoid\r\ntrapping ourselves into a strict \"low bid wins\", situation, we don't\r\nneed to tell them how we will weight those considerations and others,\r\nbut we at least deliver the message that IPv6 is important to us.\r\nAnd we do so without shooting ourselves in the foot if it is not\r\navailable at all from any vendor who is considered competent on other\r\ndimensions or not available except at a unacceptable marginal price.\r\n\r\nI think that, if the service for which an RFP is being issued\r\ninvolves a particular IETF applications-level protocol, the RFP\r\nshould either require conformance or, if that is impractical for some\r\nreason, ask vendors to explain why they cannot or will not conform or\r\nquote a marginal price for conformance.  Not really very different.\r\n\r\n    john\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]\r\nhttps://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ietf/2XfTTqyUEk_onNA0soAJaH2kuMA\r\n\r\n",

And going from 32 bits to 128 bits (or 64 if you want to look at it\r\nthat way) is simply too much leverage to hand over to the attackers.\r\n\r\nAnd that is also the reason I don't see SMTP worth fighting for. The\r\nprinciple of running open services that are not owned by a proprietary\r\nservice provider is worth fighting for, the ability to use 50 year old\r\nprotocols written when we didn't know what we were doing and didn't have\r\nthe scale or the cryptography to solve the problems really isn't.\r\n\r\nYour entire BITNET argument works much better for my plan than yours. If\r\neveryone moves to Mesh/Everything SMTP will go the way of the fax machine\r\nthe way FTP has been replaced by SSH.\r\n\r\n\r\nI do have an IPv6 strategy but it's part of my naming and IoT strategy.\r\n\r\nThe problem with our current setup is that ISPs don't actually provide\r\nemail services any more, people have moved to services like Gmail because\r\nSMTP lacks address portability and so I stopped using my ISP's email when I\r\nmoved house and had to change ISP.\r\n\r\nImagine a situation in which I get to critical mass with my scheme or\r\nsomeone else gets there instead of me. Providing the communications\r\npresence service in my scheme doesn't involve any of the cost center items\r\nit currently presents. I expect any rival would have to be likewise to beat\r\nme.\r\n\r\nSo now imagine that there is a ratings service for Mesh Service Providers.\r\nLevel 1 is providing the minimal services needed to support device binding,\r\nmessaging, etc. Level 2 adds persistent data storage so the user has a\r\nTerabyte rather than a Gig and so on.\r\n\r\nWhile I can support all the features I want to support for IoT on IPv4, I\r\ncan do it a lot better on IPv6 because I can issue every user IPv6 private\r\naddress space along with their names. That means that if Alice and Bob want\r\nto connect up their non-Mesh appliances at different houses, I can glue\r\nthem together with a bit of VPN and it's like they are on the same virtual\r\nLAN. And I can automate that whole process.\r\n\r\nSo to offer the Level 3 Platinum service, an ISP is going to have to\r\nprovide IPv6. They will also have to support access to IPv4 only services\r\nbut that can be through carrier grade NAT.\r\n",

    "body": "Having spent a lot of time looking at technology transitions in an attempt\r\nto understand how to make them happen, I find that the discussion here is\r\nunfortunately misguided. Transitioning SMTP service to IPv6 only is\r\nultimately futile because there is no way to break from dual stack to IPv6\r\nonly.\r\n\r\nI run a lot of prisoner dilemma type simulations trying to get a handle on\r\nthe outcomes. Yes, I know Rational Choice is nonsense as far as human\r\nbehavior goes but the predictions it makes do converge with reality.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental problem here is that if I am running any sort of large mail\r\nservice, I am evaluated on deliverability by my customers, not by the\r\nprotocols I use. If 5% of email servers are IPv4 only, I have to support\r\nthem or my deliverability will fail and I will get complaints. IPv4\r\naddresses are not a scarce commodity as far as operators of mail services\r\ngoes and so IPv4 will always be with us as far as SMTP is concerned.\r\n\r\nSo if my IPv4 server is going to continue to be supported, why go to the\r\neffort of moving to IPv6? A secondary factor is likely the fact that\r\nconstraining the address range to 32 bits makes spam control vastly easier\r\nfor the receivers. So I would not be surprised if refusing to accept IPv6\r\nis a thing some group will insist on.\r\n\r\nI don't see this as a problem worth getting wound up about because being\r\nstuck with IPV4 is a heck of a lot less inconvenient than being stuck with\r\nSMTP. Its like suggesting we must convert the car to run on electric\r\ninstead of gas when the immediate problem is it lacks floor pans.\r\n\r\n\r\nReplacing SMTP with a new messaging system is a futile endeavor as well.\r\nBut that is not the only option. The important thing in SMTP is that it is\r\nopen service: users of any service provider can send mail to users of any\r\nother service provider and at least in principle if not in practice, anyone\r\ncan be a service provider.\r\n\r\nWe have MOQ which is 90% of an end-to-end secure transport for voice and\r\nvideo but it lacks the presence capabilities required to provide a\r\nvoice/video communications service. And that infrastructure could support\r\nasynchronous chat, mail and large file transfer as well. Replacing SMTP is\r\nfutile but introducing an all in one solution that meets all the user's\r\ncommunications needs is merely difficult.\r\n\r\nI do have drafts and running code for everything except for the MOQ\r\ninteractions. But that should not be that difficult to achieve. I will be\r\nat Dublin and should be able to demonstrate parts of my system there. I\r\nhave written all the hard parts, provisioning keys to devices, exchanging\r\nthem between users, etc. I have the presence system designed but not\r\nfinished coding. Moving from presence to support chat to handing off a\r\nshared primary secret and IP endpoints to a MOQ client is really not\r\ndifficult. If someone knows of a C# library for MOQ or a wrapper I could\r\nuse, I might be able to get that working as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople can argue about the futility of such an exercise, especially those\r\nof us who have actually run the numbers. But if there is a demand for a\r\ngenuinely open agile communications suite, I am not aware of anyone else in\r\nIETF orbit working on a proposal.\r\n\r\nOh and yes, it does provide an IPv6 transition strategy but that is a\r\nfeature of the support built in for enabling future schemes for defeating\r\ntraffic analysis which if you think about it is basically a form of NAT on\r\nsteroids. If Alice and Bob are going to establish a covert channel through\r\nsome sort of baffle network, it makes sense to allow them to connect via\r\nIPv4 or IPv6. Because Alice and Bob never communicate directly, it means\r\nAlice can talk to Bob when she is on an IPv4 only network and he is on IPv6\r\nonly.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Mon, Jul 1, 2024 at 9:46 AM Keith Moore <moore@network-heretics.com>\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n> On 7/1/24 09:35, Salz, Rich wrote:\r\n>\r\n> You are an ISP.

As per RFC 8713, challenges to this list can be made, with the following additional constraints:\r\n\r\n1. Someone who is listed but ineligible will simply be noted as ineligible.  Then if they are selected, another draw will be made and the next volunteer will be selected instead.  Please make these challenges early.\r\n\r\n2. Someone who is NOT listed, but who believes they have volunteered and are eligible, please let me know before Friday 2024-07-05.  If I receive a valid challenge regarding a missing volunteer after the first random seeds become available, that will delay the process because new random seeds will be need to be selected.\r\n\r\nNote that there was an error in the interface between the IETF registration system and the datatracker that resulted in incorrectly marking people as a volunteer for the 2024 NomCom. That error was corrected, and the fix was deployed on 4 June. We've removed the incorrect volunteer records on June 5th and new volunteer list was created.\r\n\r\nFinally, thank you to everyone who volunteered.  This is an important responsibility and we appreciate all these people being willing to serve our community in this way.\r\n\r\nThe full list of 160 volunteers with name and affiliation follows at the bottom of this email.

RFPs are typically\r\nevaluated using a best-value instead of a lowest-price standard.

So here is my question: what is different? You received SMTP\r\nfrom mail.ietf.org via its IPv6 address (2001:559:c4c7::100?), whereas\r\nmx.google.com received via 50.223.129.194.\r\n\r\nIt seems to need explanation, since mx.google.com receives from\r\nmail-sy4aus01on20700.outbound.protection.outlook.com via 2a01:111:f403:201e::700.\r\n\r\nI'd hazard a guess that Google is using a reputation mechanism of some kind,\r\nbut it would be interesting to know for sure.\r\n\r\nAnother bit of archaeology: it used to work, back in 2013:\r\n\r\n>> Received: from mail.ietf.org (mail.ietf.org.

It is\r\nentirely easy to make mistakes, as we all do.

    "body": "\r\nHiya,\r\n\r\nThis topic now has multiple threads, so I'm just picking the\r\nmost subject form the most recent mail to respond on all of\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n- It seems whomever made the call that it was ok to pick an\r\nIPv4-only vendor (and hence drop IPv6) did not first ask the\r\ncommunity. That's a so-far unrecognised error. (And to be\r\nclear: the error is in not realising that one really has to\r\nask that particular question first.)\r\n\r\n- Assertions that mail is hard are easy and sometimes used to\r\ndismiss valid concerns with \"how things are.\" I think there\r\nare many examples of medium-sized mall service providers doing\r\nthings well that get ignored all the time. I believe the thing\r\nthat is most relevantly hard is being as cost-effective as the\r\nmajor providers, who often don't really provide a very good\r\nservice when it comes to the technicalities.\r\n\r\n- I don't recall hearing there were issues with deliverability\r\nof IETF email that were down to use of IPv6. So it seems the\r\nhigh-order-bit was already fine when it comes to the facet\r\nunder discussion.\r\n\r\n- I again assert that there is no need for the IETF to use a\r\n\"major\" mail service provider. That'd mean no argument that starts\r\nwith \"major providers don't do...\" would be sufficient (i.e.\r\nmore is needed than only such an argument).\r\n\r\nAll in all, I think the LLC and IESG ought address this topic.\r\n\r\nI also continue to conclude there's a bad smell to this - not\r\ncopping on that dropping IPv6 is something that needs to be\r\ncommunicated well and justified etc. is surprisingly bad form\r\nfrom very well-intentioned and knowledgeable folk.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nS.\r\n\r\n",

And we can't expect\r\ncorporations to fix this either, Facebook can't be bothered to address the\r\ndisinformation spam masquerading as 'satire' and it has a closed platform.\r\n\r\nThe only way to effectively address abuse in an open service is to apply\r\nauthentication and authorization to every post where the authorization\r\ncriteria are chosen by the recipient.\r\n\r\nOne way we could do that for IETF is to shift from mailing lists to NNTP or\r\nIMAP. Both of which guarantee that the recipients can get the mail they\r\nhave agreed to receive because there is an opt-in. Problem there is that\r\nthe usability of such schemes is really poor because it isn't something the\r\nemail clients are set up for. Which is why there is limited uptake for the\r\nservices people have put together for this from time to time.\r\n\r\nAnother way would be to switch to a Web forum reader that had adequate\r\naffordances for users. But that also ends up being kinda sucky because IETF\r\nis separate from my main workflow. I stop following groups that move to\r\nusing GitHub for communications because I just don't follow those, they are\r\nseparate from my main workflow. Also, I find the PR mechanism to be\r\nincomprehensible. If I want to make a comment, I want to make a comment,\r\nnot fork the repository, make changes and ask for the changes to be\r\napproved. Some people can wrap their minds around that, the diminished\r\nengagement in such groups suggests others can't.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe devil is of course in the deployment. Proposing a better way for 2000\r\npeople to work is easy, getting the transition is hard.\r\n\r\nNow that I have the GUI version of the Mesh client about to release, I am\r\nturning to the problem of collaboration. I already have some assets here:\r\n\r\n1) An engine that allows posts to be added to an append only list and\r\ndistributed.\r\n\r\n2) An engine that will parse Word, Markdown or XML2RFC format and produce\r\nInternet Draft format in any of the input formats or TXT.\r\n\r\n3) A WebView client that runs on Windows, Mac, Android and iOS.\r\n\r\n4) A TKI that manages keys to effect end to end security for all of the\r\nabove and provides an end-to-end secure asynchronous messaging layer that\r\ncan be used to initiate synchronous communications[*].\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mesh is designed to enable end-to-end encrypted social media but I\r\ndon't think we need to go quite that far for this particular application.\r\nWhat I plan to build is a simple comment on Internet Drafts mechanism that\r\ncan be interacted with through a Web front end, a gui client or email.\r\n\r\nNow imagine that people start using a tool that integrates into their\r\nworkflow, letting them know that there are things to see in the places they\r\nlook. And that tool supports all the messaging required to support a\r\nWorking Group.\r\n\r\nBasically MeetEcho but for Working Group process. So when people mark up a\r\ndocument, they can differentiate a nit from a security issue or a new\r\nrequirement or identifying an error.\r\n\r\n\r\n[*] I was looking at WebRTC but MOQ is the better choice.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Sat, Jun 29, 2024 at 12:57 PM John Levine <johnl@taugh.com> wrote:\r\n\r\n> It appears that Salz, Rich <rsalz@akamai.com> said:\r\n> >\r\n> >>I do not see why the IETF needs to make use of a \"major\" email-delivery\r\n> >>service at all.

If the \r\nSMTP deployment is large enough, it can be worth hiring that specialist \r\nknowledge and running the service in-house, and it if's small enough, \r\nyou can squeak by without. The time when this sort of thing could be \r\ndone easily / at low cost is in the far distance in the rear view mirror.\r\n\r\nIt looks to me like the IETF's mail requirements fall somewhere inside \r\nthe large and increasing gap between \"trivially small\" and \"large enough \r\nto justify inhouse expertise\". There are two options here: either sink \r\nthe cost, or outsource the service.\r\n\r\nFor sure, the optics of having SMTP service unavailable over IPv6 are \r\nawkward for the IETF. Consensus is unlikely to be achieved on the topic: \r\nsome people will consistently maintain that eating IETF dog food is more \r\nimportant. Others will argue that the resourcing cost makes it non-viable.\r\n\r\nI would view it that it shows the maturity level of the operating \r\norganisation that they're given the leeway to make their own decisions \r\nabout how to allocate the finite resources that they're provided with.\r\n\r\nIf the IETF community has a difficulty with this, it would be more \r\nproductive to address the root cause (i.e. that provisioning smtp is \r\nrather expensive, and all the more so when using ipv6), rather than \r\ncomplain about the symptoms (i.e. that IETF LLC has made a decision in a \r\ndifficult operating environment which caused some people to be surprise).\r\n\r\nNick\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Hi Brian, et al.,\r\n\r\nI think this discussion is overlooking a problem with IPv6 email and anti-spam.\r\n\r\nNearly every email server today has taken the same steps to discourage spam.\r\nIf you want to send email today, you need to enable:\r\n\r\n  - SPF and/or DKIM (or better: both).\r\n    This is DNS and independent of IPv6. Not a problem.\r\n\r\n  - IP reputation\r\n    Don't come from an address that was used for spam.\r\n    Even if it's a new IP address that has an inherited block from a spammer,\r\n    getting off spam block lists (DNS:BL, RBL, etc.) is painfully hard.\r\n    Fortunately, almost none of today's block lists support IPv6.  Not a problem.\r\n\r\n  - Reverse DNS\r\n    If the sender doesn't have a reverse DNS entry, then you can't send email.\r\n    The anti-spam rules also rejects generic reverse hostnames.\r\n    (No \"DHCP\" or similar in the reverse name.)\r\n    Ah, that's the problem with IPv6 adoption. Almost none have reverse hostnames.\r\n\r\nFor smaller companies (like mine):\r\nWhile IPv4 ranges are often static and permit setting a DNS name, many upstream providers only use DHCPv6 for IPv6. Your mail server usually doesn't have a fixed IPv6 address. This means it doesn't have a reverse DNS entry. This means it can't send email over IPv6.\r\n\r\nWorse:\r\nLet's say you have two MX records.\r\n  HostA: MX priority 10 is for a host that uses ipv4 and ipv6.\r\n  HostB: MX priority 20 is for a host that only uses ipv4.\r\n\r\nIf you cannot connect to HostA, then you will fall back to HostB.\r\n\r\nBut what if you connection HostA and fail to send email over IPv6 due to no reverse hostname? It doesn't fall back to HostA over IPv4 (with reverse hostname) and doesn't fall back to HostB. Instead, it just fails.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far, the only mail server I've seen that uses IPv6 with a reverse hostname is Google/gmail. That's great for them to send email, but it does nothing to permit them to receive email.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t-Neal\r\n--\r\nNeal Krawetz, Ph.D.\r\nHacker Factor Solutions\r\nhttps://hackerfactor.com/\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Sun, Jun 30, 2024 at 08:49:16AM +1200, Brian E Carpenter wrote:\r\n> On 30-Jun-24 08:16, Michael Jones wrote:\r\n> > I’m thankful that the IETF staff is providing us with a reliable organizational mail system that works at the scale that we need.  It enables the IETF to function.  I see that as being the high-order bit here.\r\n> Upvote.\r\n> \r\n> The IETF's job here is to understand the factual reasons why the major mail services don't deliver mail over IPv6, and to find out what can be written in RFCs to change that.\r\n> \r\n> IMHO it's a secondary issue that the LLC didn't explain this in advance to the community.

More documentation will help, if only to dismiss myths.

But it seems to me that takes us back to much of\r\nthe original thread, including comments about dog food-eating.  My\r\nversion would be something like:  \r\n\r\nThe IETF does not support email over IPv6 for perfectly reasonable\r\nand pragmatic reasons which have nothing to do with deficiencies in\r\nthe protocols themselves.  However, unless we are happy with others\r\ndrawing the inference that we do not believe IPv6 support (or IPv6\r\nitself) is relevant and important, we have some obligation to either\r\nsupport it or provide a public explanation of why not. I think that\r\nexplanation might be part of the various listing of mailing lists\r\nand/or the subscription boilerplate.  We might ask vendors why they\r\ndo not have an email-over-IPv6 option and include the response and/or\r\nindicate that we are tracking the situation and will make\r\nemail-over-IPv6 available as soon as it is practical.  \r\n\r\n>From my point of view, this is mostly about the IETF's credibility\r\nwhen we establish standards and at least implicitly encourage others\r\nto use them.

In \r\nregards to my analogy being flawed, you have a point.  After sending \r\nthe message, I remembered that the IPv6 transition approach was \r\nshelved a decade.  People started writing about IPv4/IPv6 \r\nco-existence.  It's a bit like having the Pacific and Atlantic oceans \r\nside by side with the Panama Canal serving as a gateway between those \r\ntwo oceans.\r\n\r\nThe picture (please see comment about TLS v1.2) depends on how the \r\ncustomer base maps to the decimal point.  The decimal point can have \r\na significant impact on the revenue of a MNC.  There can also be \r\nother considerations.  For example, the SMTP server at your end used \r\nTLS v1.3 (the cipher was TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384) to interoperate with \r\nthe SMTP server at my end.  I would not have received your email if \r\nthe server at this end only supported TLS up to v1.2.  Now, if I was \r\nrunning an organization for charitable purposes, I may have to \r\nconsider whether it is okay to make communication difficult for you.\r\n\r\n>The email world is unfortunately still overwhelmingly ipv4 and \r\n>unlike other protocols, adding ipv6 support is not trivial.\r\n\r\nIt is quite understandable that it can be quite overwhelming for some \r\ncompanies.  A company may not have the engineering capabilities to \r\nadd IPv6 support for SMTP and IMAPv4.  It is not that difficult \r\nthough; most software have IPv6 enabled in the default \r\nconfiguration.  I actually turned mail and other services into \r\nIPv6-ready services well over a decade ago.  One of the customers had \r\na requirement that every service should be IPv6-enabled.\r\n\r\n>If you know of a cloud email delivery service that supports ipv6, is \r\n>cost-effective, reputable and reliable, please share it with us.\r\n>The goal of the migration is to stop relying on a single, expensive, \r\n>unstable, self-hosted machine and instead let a cloud provider \r\n>handle the infrastructure in a reliable and scalable way.\r\n\r\n From the above description I gather that the policy of the IETF LLC \r\nis to outsource everything.  I would need more information on the \r\nrequirements as they are a bit subjective. Is there any information \r\navailable about the SMTP traffic?  Does the LLC require compliance \r\nwith commercially-viable standards?  Is there any publicly available \r\ninformation on the opex for the machine and ancillary expenses?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nS.

The \r\nresponse time and technical support on the rare occasions where I \r\nencountered an issue was well above average.\r\n\r\nJohn has a point on the comment about \"nobody noticed\" when the IETF \r\nmail server was no longer sending mail over IPv6.  I don't know \r\nanything about the cost implications.  I took a look at the latest \r\ncontracts and some plenary slides to find out more about the changes \r\nto IETF mail infrastructure as I may have missed the reading the \r\ninformation about the IPv6 change.  It seemed a bit odd that the IETF \r\nLLC was outsourcing its mail service to a cloud provider (please see \r\nmy comment about the mail service over the years).\r\n\r\nLet's say the change was for another protocol, e.g. TLS.  Would the \r\npeople agree to a move from v.1.3 to v.1.2 because that is what the \r\noutsourcing provider offers?\r\n\r\nGetting back to the second part of your comment, I would look at it \r\nin terms of managing growth.  It would be interesting to see whether \r\nthe IETF LLC's decision will influence other LLCs to follow a similar \r\npath, and the overall effect.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nS. Moonesamy  \r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Hi Eliot, All,\r\n\r\nI read draft-lear-bcp83-replacement-00.  Its purpose is  to change \r\nthe procedure for the IETF discussion list.  The rationale given is \r\nthe recent happenings on the Last Call mailing list (which is a \r\ndifferent mailing list).  That seems a bit odd.\r\n\r\nI'll mention the following as there seems to be different \r\ninterpretation of the word \"moderation\".  RFC 6279 was issued in \r\nresponse to an issue pertaining to moderation.  There is a definition \r\nof what moderation means on Page 4.  There used to be moderation, \r\nmost likely because of how the mailing list manager works.\r\n\r\nI already commented about the executive director (Section 1.3).  My \r\ncomment was not about the person filling in that position.  That \r\nsection explains the reason for having a jury.  The authors then \r\nargue for having the executive director handle complaints and make \r\ndecisions.  I suggest rewriting the last sentence in the first \r\nparagraph or else putting that in an appendix.\r\n\r\nSection 2.6 states that there shall either be a working group \r\nannouncement or an IETF-wide announcement.  Why would an entire \r\ncountry being interested in some infraction which occurred in some \r\nsmall town (a working group)?\r\n\r\nUnwanted mail (Section 3) is currently handled by the IETF LLC (I did \r\nnot verify the details).  I would stay out of that.\r\n\r\nThe visibility (Section 4) is a positive step as it allows people \r\ninterested in such matters to see whether the policy is effective or not.\r\n\r\nI'll mention some other points if there is interest in moving the \r\ndraft forward.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nS. Moonesamy\r\n\r\n",

For the case of list management and\r\nmoderation and given what can be a fine line between forcefully\r\nexpressing opinions that differ from others in the community\r\n(especially IESG members) and being more or less deliberately\r\ndisruptive, putting more authority into the hands of the IESG seems\r\nunwise and putting it in the hands of the Chair even less wise.  The\r\noptics of the people who decided whether or not there is consensus\r\ndeciding whether someone gets to participate in the IETF or who\r\ncounts in other ways are rather poor.   At least in principle, that\r\nis the attraction of both BCP 83/RFC 3683 and the\r\nOmbudsteam/Anti-Harassment procedures of RFC 7776 (with 8716): in the\r\nformer case, there is a community process involved.   In the latter,\r\nthe ombudsteam is supposedly independent of the people who appoint\r\nthem [1].\r\n\r\nWarren's suggestion [2] is attractive in that regard because it\r\nrequires three, presumably, independent, people to agree.   But I\r\nthink it raises a question and suggests another way to think about\r\nthis without creating more processes:\r\n\r\n(1) I don't have a complete list of things that would cause a message\r\nto be so egregious and problematic as to require emergency action,\r\nnor do I think it would be wise for us to try to make such a list.\r\nHowever, all of them I can think of would fall into a reasonable\r\ninterpretation of the \"other problematic behavior that may be more\r\npersonal... nonetheless is unacceptable behavior between IETF\r\nParticipants\" explanation that is part of the introduction to RFC\r\n7776.  I read RFC 7776 as allowing the ombudsteam to take immediate\r\naction in a sufficiently obvious and egregious case.  Presumably the\r\nRespondent could appeal such action using the procedure described in\r\nSection 6 of RFC 7776.  Independent of what is said there, a further\r\nappeal to the community might be possible by the Respondent choosing\r\nto make the claimed problem behavior more public than RFC7776 allows,\r\nbut, for the type of cases we have been discussing and that\r\ndraft-ecahc-moderation appears to address, it would already be very\r\npublic, so that is a non-issue.  I hope no one would ever feel a need\r\nto go there, but note that the last paragraph of Section 1 of RFC\r\n7776 probably provides another path to a sort of appeal in cases\r\nwhere the actions and remedies of the Ombudsteam are, themselves,\r\nperceived of a egregious or deliberately unfair.\r\n\r\nSo it appears to me that the first line of defense against egregious\r\nacts or statements should be the ombudsteam: no new procedures needed\r\nexcept, possibly, clarification of their ability to take immediate\r\naction and a broader appeal mechanism if the Respondent decides to\r\nmake the matter public.\r\n\r\n(2) As suggested above and as part of the earlier thread, the key\r\nproblem with RFC 3683 is that the process it requires is too slow for\r\nan emergency.  The suggestion above should eliminate most need to use\r\nit for emergencies (and probably should have done so before this),\r\nespecially for cases that broadly involve harassment.  For those\r\ncases, the Reporter (possibly including the IETF Chair or the IESG)\r\nshould be taking cases to the Ombudsteam rather than trying to take\r\nPR-rights actions themselves.  For whatever other cases might exist,\r\nit would seem reasonable to me to allow the IESG to immediately (but\r\ntemporarily) suspend posting rights for the duration of the Last Call\r\nprocess to prevent further damage while the PR-rights action is being\r\nconsidered by the community.  Again, no new or complicated procedures\r\nneeded other than to modify BCP 83 to allow the IESG to take that\r\ntemporary action (presumably by recorded vote so that individual ADs\r\ncan be held accountable if the community perceives that abuses have\r\noccurred).\r\n\r\nFinally...\r\n\r\n--On Sunday, June 23, 2024 16:23 +0200 Eliot Lear <lear@lear.ch>\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n> In the case of NOMCOM-appointed people you recall them.  In the\r\n> case of the IED, you complain to the LLC, and you use the appeals\r\n> process.  There is always redress.  But keep this in mind: we\r\n> entrust all of these people with a whole lot more responsibility\r\n> than this today.\r\n\r\nWhile I mostly agree, especially with your last sentence, the number\r\nof times we have successfully carried a recall procedure to\r\ncompletion in the last 27 years suggests either that there have never\r\nbeen abuses of authority by a Nomcom-selected person or that the\r\nprocedure is not effective.   In particular, as has been pointed out\r\nseveral times when attempts have been made to initiate recall\r\nprocedures, the length of time that process would take in practice\r\nmakes it useless, even for egregious cases, in the last six or nine\r\nmonths of an incumbent's term.  On the other hand, I think we can\r\nview that as a separate problem which the community either has the\r\nwill and ability to address or it doesn't.\r\n\r\nbest,\r\n   john\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The provision for the IETF Chair to remove ombudsteam members\r\n(Sections 3.7 and 3.8 of RFC 7776) may make that independence\r\nquestionable, but that is really a separate problem.\r\n\r\n[2]\r\nhttps://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ietf/L6ssBezh6LJt66o4IKz27wZH27w\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Any other suggestions?\r\n\r\nAs for the actual moderation policy, I think there should be community\r\nreview, but somebody has to draft the policy and keep it up to\r\ndate, and the moderators themselves seem well placed to do that.\r\n  \r\n> Many years ago, Russ informed this mailing list that he took a\r\n> decision on a message which was posted to the list.

The motivation is to deal with \r\n\"disruptive behavior\" (Section 3) given that the IESG-led process \r\n(authors' description) of PR-actions is viewed as ineffective.\r\n\r\nIf the problem is the following: \"The IETF community has not been \r\nable to agree on a common definition of disruptive behavior.\", the \r\nfix proposed by the authors would be to have the IETF community agree \r\nto the IETF Chair appointing some people to agree on some definition \r\nand be responsible for the implementation.  Such an approach caused a \r\nproblem previously, if I am not mistaken.  The reaction to that was \r\nto prevent the IETF Chair from intervening in the day-to-day operation.\r\n\r\nMany years ago, Russ informed this mailing list that he took a \r\ndecision on a message which was posted to the list.

IETF 120 Board Game Night is not a replacement for the social event but will provide an opportunity to come together and play games. \r\n\r\nWe are excited to announce the very first IETF Board Game Night! On Tuesday, 23 July 2024, please join us in the Grouse room located on the 34th floor of the Hyatt Regency Vancouver for an evening of board games, light snacks, and non-alcoholic beverages. Gaming will be available from 18:45-23:00 PDT and will stay open throughout the week to continue your gaming adventures.\r\n\r\nBoard games and puzzles will be provided, and we are seeking community feedback on which games to provide. We plan to offer games that vary in difficulty and game play length, such as Uno [1] and Bananagrams [2], as well as more difficult ones such as Cascadia [3] and Planet Unknown [4].\r\n\r\nIf you have a suggestion for a game we should add to the IETF collection, please send it to support@ietf.org. Please also let us know if you’re willing to teach others how to play it during Game Night. If you have a game you love and want to bring it to play, we encourage you to do so. \r\n\r\nAttending IETF 120 remotely? We will be opening a variety of virtual rooms for you to join in as well! More details to follow.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to seeing you there!\r\n\r\n# Registration Reminder\r\n\r\nEarly registration pricing for IETF 120 Vancouver is available until 23:59 UTC 8 July 2024.

As John \r\nmentioned, it is could be viewed as a matter involving a person/s and \r\nwhere other people would be pass judgement.  I agree that in matters \r\ninvolving people there can be likes or dislikes, who sides with whom, \r\netc.  As I see it, and I could be wrong, it is sometimes better to \r\nreach a conclusion in a logical and sensible way.\r\n\r\nJohn mentioned that there was a party who was afforded an opportunity \r\nto speak.  There can be other parties with an interest in a \r\nmatter.  Let's assume that a matter falls under RFC 7776.  There is \r\nthe following text in it:\r\n\r\n   \"All IETF Participants are encouraged to talk with the Ombudsteam\r\n    if they are uncomfortable or unsure about any behaviors.\"\r\n\r\nThere would be some reason why that text is written in such a manner.\r\n\r\n>That, IMO, is part of a very separate problem.

    "body": "Me: why not use AI to monitor a problematic poster on a mailing list?\r\n\r\nChatGPT:\r\n\r\nUsing AI to monitor problematic behavior on a mailing list is definitely a\r\npossibility and has been explored in various contexts. AI can help in\r\nseveral ways:\r\n\r\n1. **Content Moderation**: AI algorithms can scan messages for\r\ninappropriate content, such as hate speech, harassment, or spam, and flag\r\nthem for review by moderators.\r\n\r\n2. **Behavior Analysis**: AI can analyze patterns of behavior, such as\r\nfrequency of posts, language used, or interactions with other members, to\r\nidentify potential problems or conflicts.\r\n\r\n3. **Early Detection**: AI can detect emerging issues or conflicts before\r\nthey escalate, allowing moderators to intervene early and prevent further\r\ndisruption.\r\n\r\n4. **User Profiling**: AI can create profiles of individual users based on\r\ntheir posting history and behavior, which can help moderators identify\r\nrepeat offenders or problematic users.\r\n\r\nHowever, it's important to note that AI is not perfect and may not always\r\naccurately identify problematic behavior. Additionally, there are ethical\r\nconsiderations to take into account, such as privacy concerns and the\r\npotential for algorithmic bias. Therefore, while AI can be a useful tool\r\nfor monitoring mailing lists, it should be used in conjunction with human\r\nmoderators who can provide context, judgment, and oversight.\r\n\r\nOn Mon, Jun 10, 2024 at 9:53 PM Brian E Carpenter <\r\nbrian.e.carpenter@gmail.com> wrote:\r\n\r\n>\r\n> On 11-Jun-24 15:50, Rob Sayre wrote:\r\n> > On Mon, Jun 10, 2024 at 12:59 PM Gorsic (US), Bonnie L <\r\n> bonnie.l.gorsic@boeing.com <mailto:bonnie.l.gorsic@boeing.com>> wrote:\r\n> >\r\n> >     Why not use AI to monitor his posts and if offensive words are used,\r\n> don’t allow them on the list?\r\n> >\r\n> >\r\n> > Interesting.

I still sometimes realize that I don't\r\nknow what to do next when some new situation comes up, and then I have to\r\npretty much apologize, flee, and go figure it out.

We can also look at the trainings that\r\nvarious orgs do on these topics. It's really not that hard. A lot of good\r\nwork has been done in this area—we don't have to reinvent the wheel.\r\n\r\nThat said, the idea that this should be a voluntary tutorial is maybe\r\nquestionable.

I don’t mean\r\nthat someone steps in once after a pattern of abusive behavior has\r\ncontinued for multiple exchanges over a day or more.\r\n\r\nRegarding the rules, I very much meant what I said there: if you are\r\nsocially competent, I’m sure the rules are quite clear, but for someone who\r\nis not, figuring out what behaviors are okay and what aren’t is hard: my\r\ngo-to is simply to never do anything that I can even conjecture might\r\nviolate one of these rules or ever make anyone in any way uncomfortable.\r\nAnd I still screw up. So simply dismissing my comment about this feels\r\npretty unhelpful, although I realize it may seem a bit off-topic. I think\r\nbeing clear, giving examples, etc, might actually be useful for some\r\nparticipants. It might even prevent some people from getting angry and\r\nacting out, which was my point.\r\n\r\nOp ma 10 jun 2024 om 17:00 schreef Brian E Carpenter <\r\nbrian.e.carpenter@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n> Why was this thread on the last-call list?

Their posting \r\nrights to the ietf@ietf.org mailing list have been requested to be \r\nrestricted for the next 14 days.  We encourage everyone to review the \r\nIETF discussion list charter [4] and avoid postings that include uncivil \r\ncommentary [5].\r\n\r\nWe are aware there is overlap with Anti-Harassment policy, and a related \r\nconsultation is going on in Last-Call [6], but this particular L2 action \r\nis separate and independent of that. Its 14 day period will expire on \r\nJune 24, but input for [6] is open until July 6.

(Please note that volunteering via the registration system is not offered for IETF 120 registration.)\r\n\r\nThis error was corrected, and the fix was deployed on June 4. The correction for the bug can be viewed at https://github.com/ietf-tools/datatracker/pull/7484.\r\n\r\nWe have removed the incorrect volunteer records as of June 5. However, this has led to a severely reduced number of eligible volunteers (below 90). Please review your status and consider volunteering for NomCom 2024-2025. Please check your status at https://datatracker.ietf.org/accounts/profile/ after signing in under the \"NomCom Eligible\" section,. If you have already explicitly volunteered using the datatracker, you will see \"You have volunteered for the Nominating Committee 2024/2025.” If you are not yet volunteered, you will see a Volunteer button.\r\n\r\nYou can also volunteer via\r\nCLICK HERE TO VOLUNTEER: https://datatracker.ietf.org/nomcom/volunteer\r\n\r\nor directly emailing me at nomcom-chair-2024@ietf.org\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who has volunteered so far.

    "body": "\"My dissertation focused on sexism in the IETF\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"My gender was even more salient than my age. As mentioned, it is hard not to notice the gender gap in the IETF. The IETF’s official statistics show that, on average, only about 10 per cent of its participants identify as women. A gender gap is also evident from participating in the meetings and reflected in the pictures included in this chapter. Being a woman marked me as a minority. My gender exposed me to some of the rough edges of IETF culture that perhaps a male researcher would have been shielded from. My experiences ranged from being mistaken for ‘a partner to an IETF engineer’ to being subjected to unsolicited sexual advances. Being exposed to the sexism in the IETF was not fun but could be informative. In Chapter Six, I use these experiences to articulate the cultural currency of a distinctly white, male, Euro-American approach to engineering in the IETF. As a woman, I also found that many of my women interlocutors were comfortable sharing their experiences of sexism with me. They told me things that they had not brought up when previously interviewed by male researchers, or even with their male peers.\"\r\n\r\n-- Dr Corinne Cath-Speth, Changing Minds and Machines, DPhil thesis, Oxford University, 2021.\r\n\r\nhttps://corinnecath.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CathCorinne-Thesis-DphilInformationCommunicationSocialSciences.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\nLloyd Wood\r\nlloyd.wood@yahoo.co.uk\r\n\r\n\r\ngiven the choice between facing an IETF member or facing a bear, women will choose the bear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday 4 June 2024 at 21:22:08 GMT+10, Timothy Mcsweeney <tim@dropnumber.com> wrote: \r\n\r\n\r\nThanks Corinne,  you're pretty good looking.  Maybe at the next IETF meeting we could have lunch or something?\r\n\r\n\r\n> On 06/04/2024 7:14 AM EDT Corinne Cath <corinnecath@gmail.com> wrote:\r\n> \r\n>  \r\n> Is it possible that the list is nothing, not 'stupid' nor anything else\r\n> negative but that you don't see the need for it? might seem like a nuance,\r\n> but matters to be precise in our language no? both in terms of having a\r\n> good conversation and doing so with a basic level of professionalism just\r\n> my .2 ccs\r\n> \r\n> On Tue, Jun 4, 2024 at 12:54 PM Timothy Mcsweeney <tim@dropnumber.com>\r\n> wrote:\r\n> \r\n> > Thanks for the link, glad to see other people think its stupid too.\r\n> >\r\n> >\r\n> >\r\n> > > On 06/04/2024 6:39 AM EDT Christian Hopps <chopps@chopps.org> wrote:\r\n> > >\r\n> > >\r\n> > > FWIW, this has been discussed previously, at length, multiple times, and\r\n> > reasonable people disagreed with your claim of \"stupidity\".

First, I hope we can agree that trying to maintain\r\ndifferent passwords for different sites and keeping those passwords\r\nlong and moderately complex is somewhere between \"good idea\" and\r\n\"necessary\" in these troubled times.  Like many or most of those who\r\nspecialize in computer security, I wish we could do away with\r\npasswords entirely and replace them with more secure and easier to\r\nuse mechanisms but that does not seem to be happening very quickly.  \r\n\r\nAbsent the ability to remember dozens (or more) long, non-mnemonic\r\nand unrelated passwords, \"password managers\" are almost inevitable,\r\nwhether they be a software-supported \"vault\", a carefully safeguarded\r\nsheet of paper from which one can copy things, or anything else.\r\nAnd there is no need to use a \"service\", much less to entrust the\r\nservice with passwords in the clear.  I know people who encrypt a\r\npassword collection, with or without specialized software, put it on\r\nthe equivalent of a USB stick and carry it around with them,\r\nextracting passwords one at a time as needed.  Or one might encrypt\r\nthe vault and store it \"in the cloud\" or with some service but keep\r\nthe encryption keys local and be sure that passwords are available in\r\nthe clear only on one's own trusted equipment.   Seems to me that,\r\nshort of memorizing lots of long passwords, those methods are not\r\ninherently unreasonable even though storing passwords in the clear\r\nwith a third party might be.\r\n\r\nbest,\r\n   john\r\n\r\n> \r\n> Keith\r\n> \r\n\r\n\r\n",

Perhaps it would have\r\nbeen clearer and better for me to ask \"is the mailman3/ Postorium\r\nenvironment fully under IETF control or has it been at least\r\npartially outsourced to other parties?\"  Apparently the answer is the\r\nlatter, in which case sharing passwords is clearly a bad idea.  \r\n\r\nIn the near term, this suggests that the messages to people about\r\nestablishing new accounts should be clear about this too.  If, as\r\nsuggested below, the need for those separate accounts it temporary,\r\nthat should be clear too (and that many of these problems may be just\r\ncommunications failures).  \r\n\r\nI've leave any discussion on whether it is a good idea for the IETF\r\nto put information about its mailing lists and who is on which ones\r\n-- information that, with most systems, can be more easily\r\ncompromised than passwords and other login credentials -- into the\r\nhands of a third party for others at another time.  Similarly, the\r\nquestion of whether Mailman3 should have been deployed before those\r\nadditional changes were ready is, as I'm sure you will agree, best\r\nleft for another time and probably (see below) another list.\r\n\r\n>> For those of us who\r\n>> prefer to use relatively complex passwords and different passwords\r\n>> for different sites/organizations, and who use password managers to\r\n>> make that tolerable, managing different passwords for more or less\r\n>> the same domain is feasible, but not a lot of fun.  \r\n> \r\n> The use of password managers is good security practice and strongly\r\n> recommended.

First, and most generally, I have noticed that there is a\r\ntendency to confuse discussions (and even conclusions) on\r\ntools-discuss with discussions and conclusions with the community and\r\nabout which the community is fully informed.  Having those\r\ndiscussions on a separate list makes it far easier for much of the\r\ncommunity to follow this list (although I gather that those who do so\r\nis going down) but there is no way to be sure that all members of the\r\ncommunity who are interested, much less all of those who might be\r\naffected, are actively following that other list and have consented\r\nto whatever is discussed there.  Even being on the tools-discuss list\r\ndoesn't mean much about community consensus: as an example that I\r\ndoubt is unique to me, I do try to follow that list but my reading\r\nmessages tends to be intermittent.  How carefully can follow the list\r\nis a function of other commitments, including IETF commitments, and\r\nit simply cannot be of highest priority to me if I'm to get work that\r\nI believe is more important done.  \r\n\r\nSecond, we've got a well-established mechanism for handling work in\r\nspecialized WGs, which is to put their conclusions (ideally with a\r\ndiscussion of pros, cons, and tradeoffs if answers did not seem\r\ncompletely clear within the group) into a public Last Call process.\r\nPerhaps conclusions on tools-discuss that might have broad community\r\nimpact should be subjected to the same process with discussion of\r\ncontext, pros, and cons as a requirement.  \r\n\r\nThird, I may be misinterpreting that picture but I see a few things\r\non it that set off alarms, especially if the IETF expects its work\r\nand processes to be taken as a good example for the community (I\r\nsuppose that would be \"not just eat our own dogfood, but hope others\r\nwill follow a similar diet).  If we drop that expectation, we, at\r\nleast IMO, reduce the credibility of our standards, something that is\r\nproblematic in a voluntary adoption environment..  I'll try to find\r\ntime to raise those alarming issues on tools-discuss as you suggest.\r\n\r\nbest,\r\n   john\r\n\r\n",
