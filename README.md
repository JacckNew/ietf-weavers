# IETF Weavers

**Visualising the social and discursive architecture of Internet standard-making**

This project explores how technical standards are created within the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), by analyzing communication patterns, social structures, and thematic discussions through the lens of social network analysis (SNA) and natural language processing (NLP). The visualisations are rendered using D3.js to make influence, collaboration, and language dynamics visible and explorable.

---

## 🔍 Project Goals

- Analyze participant influence and interaction structure within IETF working groups
- Detect and model dominant discussion topics and how they diffuse over time
- Compare linguistic behavior and roles using dialogue act and stylistic analysis
- Present all insights through a fully interactive web-based dashboard

**Social and Discursive Dynamics of Internet Standard-making**

A comprehensive analysis and visualization tool for understanding collaboration patterns, influence networks, and community dynamics within the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) through email communication analysis.

## 📋 Project Overview

IETF Weavers combines social network analysis (SNA) and natural language processing (NLP) to visualize how Internet standards are developed through human collaboration. The project analyzes IETF mailing lists and draft authorship patterns to reveal:

- **Social Networks**: Who collaborates with whom in Internet standard development
- **Influence Patterns**: Key connectors and opinion leaders in technical communities  
- **Community Structure**: Working group boundaries and cross-pollination
- **Topic Evolution**: How technical discussions emerge and evolve over time
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Patterns of information flow and expertise sharing
