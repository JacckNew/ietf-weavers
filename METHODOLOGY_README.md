# IETF Email Network Analysis: Data Collection and Processing Methodology

## Project Overview
This project analyzes social network patterns in IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) email communications to understand collaboration dynamics, influence patterns, and community structure within the technical standards development process.

## Data Collection Architecture

### 1. Data Sources
- **IETF Mail Archive**: Historical email communications from IETF mailing lists
- **IETF Datatracker**: Participant metadata, affiliations, and document history
- **Working Group Information**: Mailing list classifications and status over time

### 2. Core Data Infrastructure

#### Email Data Collection (`email-messages-year.py`)
```python
# Core Components:
- Email extraction from all IETF mailing lists
- Email address normalization and cleaning
- Person identification and deduplication
- Temporal categorization by year/month
- Email type classification (automated, role-based, individual)
```

**Key Processing Steps:**
1. **Email Extraction**: Iterates through all IETF mailing lists using `ietfdata.mailarchive`
2. **Address Parsing**: Uses regex patterns to extract and normalize email addresses
3. **Person Mapping**: Creates unified person identities across multiple email addresses
4. **Categorization**: Classifies emails into categories:
   - **Datatracker-mapped**: Emails linked to official IETF participants
   - **Role-based**: Official position emails (chairs, ads, etc.)
   - **Automated**: System-generated emails (notifications, archives, etc.)
   - **Non-datatracker**: Individual emails not in official records

#### Person Identity Resolution
```python
# Multi-step identity linking process:
1. URI-based matching (official datatracker records)
2. Name-based matching across different sources
3. Email-based clustering for same individuals
4. Cross-validation with affiliation data
```

### 3. Data Processing Pipeline

#### Stage 1: Raw Data Collection
- Extract all messages from IETF mailing lists
- Parse email headers (from, to, date, message-id)
- Build comprehensive email-to-person mappings

#### Stage 2: Email Classification System
```python
# Automated Email Detection Patterns:
- Archive systems: "*-archive@*", "*-bounces@*"
- System notifications: "noreply@*", "notification@*"
- IETF tools: "trac+*@tools.ietf.org"
- Administrative: "*-secretary@*", "*-secretariat@*"

# Role-based Email Patterns:
- Working group chairs: "*-chairs@ietf.org"
- Area directors: "*-ads@ietf.org"
- IETF official roles: "chair@ietf.org", "ietf-*@ietf.org"
```

#### Stage 3: Network Interaction Mapping (`V2-generate_personID_personID_mappings.py`)
- **Thread Analysis**: Parse email thread structures to identify interactions
- **Reply Patterns**: Track who responds to whom in conversations
- **Temporal Dynamics**: Capture timing and frequency of interactions
- **Context Mapping**: Link interactions to specific mailing lists and topics

### 4. Feature Engineering for Social Network Analysis

#### Individual-Level Features
- **Communication Volume**: Number of emails sent per person/year
- **Network Position**: Centrality measures (degree, betweenness, eigenvector)
- **Temporal Activity**: First email date, activity duration, peak periods
- **Influence Metrics**: Response rates, thread initiation frequency
- **Collaboration Breadth**: Number of different mailing lists participated in

#### Relationship-Level Features
- **Interaction Frequency**: Number of direct exchanges between pairs
- **Response Latency**: Time between email and response
- **Thread Participation**: Joint participation in discussion threads
- **Topic Overlap**: Shared participation across different technical areas

#### Network-Level Features
- **Community Structure**: Working group vs. research group participation
- **Cross-group Collaboration**: Inter-group communication patterns
- **Leadership Networks**: Connections between chairs and area directors
- **Newcomer Integration**: How new participants connect to existing networks

### 5. Data Quality and Validation

#### Email Address Normalization
```python
# Standardization Process:
1. Convert all addresses to lowercase
2. Handle obfuscated addresses ("user at domain" → "user@domain")
3. Remove display name artifacts and formatting
4. Validate email format patterns
5. Map aliases to canonical addresses
```

#### Spam and Noise Filtering
- **Automated Detection**: Filter system-generated messages
- **Manual Curation**: Maintain lists of known automated senders
- **Pattern Matching**: Identify promotional/spam content
- **Validation**: Cross-check against known IETF participant lists

#### Person Identity Validation
- **Multi-source Verification**: Cross-reference with datatracker records
- **Name Disambiguation**: Handle name variations and aliases
- **Affiliation Tracking**: Monitor job changes and institutional moves
- **Quality Metrics**: Track confidence levels for person mappings

## Key Technical Methodologies

### 1. Email Thread Reconstruction
```python
# Thread Analysis Algorithm:
1. Parse Message-ID and In-Reply-To headers
2. Build directed graph of message relationships
3. Identify thread roots and conversation trees
4. Handle missing/broken thread references
5. Extract interaction patterns from thread structure
```

### 2. Temporal Network Analysis
- **Time Windows**: Analysis by year, month, and event periods
- **Activity Cycles**: Identify seasonal patterns and meeting effects
- **Evolution Tracking**: Monitor network changes over time
- **Event Correlation**: Link communication patterns to IETF meetings and deadlines

### 3. Multi-layer Network Construction
```python
# Network Layers:
- Email exchange networks (who emails whom)
- Reply networks (who responds to whom)
- Mailing list co-participation (shared venues)
- Working group collaboration (formal relationships)
- Document co-authorship (from datatracker)
```

## Data Export and Analysis Formats

### Primary Data Products
1. **Person-to-Person Interaction Matrices**: Weighted adjacency matrices by time period
2. **Individual Feature Vectors**: Comprehensive profiles for each participant
3. **Network Metadata**: Mailing list classifications, timestamps, message types
4. **Temporal Snapshots**: Network states at different time points
